ECigarettes
A Scientific Review

Rachel Grana PhD MPH Neal  Benowitz MD  Stanton A Glantz PhD

Electronic cigarettes ecigarettes are products that deliver 

a nicotinecontaining aerosol commonly called vapor to 
users  by  heating  a  solution  typically  made  up  of  propylene 
glycol  or  glycerol  glycerin  nicotine  and  flavoring  agents 
Figure  invented in their current form by Chinese pharma
cist Hon  Lik in the early s The US patent  application 
describes the ecigarette device as an electronic atomization 
cigarette that functions as substitutes sic for quitting smok
ing and cigarette substitutes patent No  B By 
 the major multinational tobacco companies had entered 
the  ecigarette  market  Ecigarettes  are  marketed  via  televi
sion the Internet and print advertisements that often feature 
celebrities  as  healthier  alternatives  to  tobacco  smoking  as 
useful for quitting smoking and reducing cigarette consump
tion and as a way to circumvent smokefree laws by enabling 
users to smoke anywhere

There  has  been  rapid  market  penetration  of  ecigarettes 
despite many unanswered questions about their safety effi
cacy for harm reduction and cessation and total impact on 
public health Ecigarette products are changing quickly and 
many of the findings from studies of older products may not 
be  relevant  to  the  assessment  of  newer  products  that  could 
be safer and more effective as nicotine delivery devices In 
addition marketing and other environmental influences may 
vary from country to country so patterns of use and the ulti
mate impact on public health may differ The individual risks 
and benefits and the total impact of these products occur in 
the  context  of  the  widespread  and  continuing  availability 
of conventional cigarettes and other tobacco products with 
high levels of dual use of ecigarettes and conventional ciga
rettes  at  the  same  time  among  adults  and  youth  It  is 
important  to  assess  ecigarette  toxicant  exposure  and  indi
vidual  risk  as  well  as  the  health  effects  of  ecigarettes  as 
they  are  actually  used  to  ensure  safety  and  to  develop  an 
evidencebased  regulatory  scheme  that  protects  the  entire 
populationchildren  and  adults  smokers  and  nonsmok
ersin the context of how the tobacco industry is marketing 
and promoting these products Health claims and claims of 
efficacy for quitting smoking are unsupported by the scien
tific  evidence  to  date  To  minimize  the  potential  negative 

impacts on prevention and cessation and the undermining of 
existing tobacco control measures  ecigarette use should be 
prohibited where tobacco cigarette use is prohibited and the 
products should be subject to the same marketing restrictions 
as tobacco cigarettes

Methods
Initial  searches  conducted  via  PubMed  using  the  key  words  elec
tronic cigarette ecigarette and electronic nicotine delivery systems 
yielded  studies Figure  Seventyone articles presented origi
nal  data  and  were  included  Eighty  articles  were  excluded  because 
they were not relevant were not in English or were reviews or com
mentaries that did not provide original data although some are cited 
for  background  and  context  Searches  using  the  same  search  terms 
were conducted using World Health Organization regional databases 
only BIBLIOTECA Virtual em Salude Latin America and Caribbean 
included relevant papers all of which had already been located with 
PubMed Working with the World Health Organization we also con
tacted investigators to locate other studies some of which had not yet 
been published submitted or in press We also reviewed technical 
reports prepared by health organizations news articles and rel
evant Web sites The results of these searches were used to prepare 
a  report  commissioned  by  the World  Health  Organization  Tobacco 
Free Initiative which provides details of individual studies including 
some studies that are not discussed in this article because of length 
constraints After  the  manuscript  was  submitted  for  peer  review   
more articles became available resulting in a total of  articles form
ing the basis for this review

The Product
Ecigarette  devices  are  manufactured  mainly  in  China As 
of late  there was wide variability in ecigarette prod
uct  engineering  including  varying  nicotine  concentrations 
in  the  solution  used  to  generate  the  nicotine  aerosol  also 
called eliquid varying volumes of solution in the product 
different  carrier  compounds  most  commonly  propylene 
glycol with or without glycerol glycerin a wide range of 
additives  and  flavors  and  battery  voltage  Quality  control 
is  variable  and  users  can  modify  many  of  the  products 
including  using  them  to  deliver  other  drugs  such  as  mari
juana These engineering differences result in variability 
in how ecigarettes heat and convert the nicotine solution to 
an aerosol and consequently the levels of nicotine and other

Marketing and Media Research
Consumer perceptions of the risks and benefits and deci
sions  to  use  ecigarettes  are  heavily  influenced  by  how 
they  are  marketed  Celebrities  have  been  used  to  mar
ket  ecigarettes  since  at  least    Grana  and  Ling 
reviewed     singlebrand  ecigarette  retail  Web  sites  in 
 and found that the most popular claims were that the 
products are healthier  cheaper  and cleaner 
  than  cigarettes  can  be  smoked  anywhere   
can be used to circumvent smokefree policies  do 
not  produce  secondhand  smoke    and  are  modern 
 Health claims made through text and pictorial and 
video  representations  of  doctors  were  present  on    of 
sites  Cessationrelated  claims  direct  and  indirect  state
ments were found on  of sites Marketing on the sites 
commonly stated that ecigarettes produce only harmless 

water  vapor  Similar  messaging  strategies  were  being 
used in the United Kingdom

These marketing messages have been repeated in the media 
A  thematic  analysis  of  newspaper  and  online  media  cover
age  about  ecigarettes  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  Scotland 
from  July    to  June    found    themes  healthier 
choice circumventing smokefree restrictions celebrity use 
price  and  risk  and  uncertainty  Coverage  often  included 
anecdotes  about  having  tried  nicotine  replacement  therapies 
NRTs failing to quit and then trying the ecigarette such 
as  the  celebrity  endorsement  by  actress  Katherine  Heigl  on 
the US David Letterman television program implying that 
 ecigarettes are a more effective form of NRT

Ecigarette companies also have a strong presence in social 
media which reinforces their marketing messages including 
repeating  the  use  of  celebrity  endorsements  eg  Heigl  and 
spreading images of the UK musical group Girls Aloud puff
ing on ecigarettes to cope with the stress of their th anni
versary tour

Cigarette and other tobacco companies have been unable to 
market their products on television and radio since the s 
Ecigarette advertising on television and radio is mass market
ing of an addictive nicotine product for use in a recreational 
manner to new generations who have never experienced such 
marketing  In  an  online  convenience  sample  of    adult

smokers  and  recent  quitters  who  viewed  a  television  com
mercial for Blu ecigarettes  of current smokers reported 
that  the  ad  made  them  think  about  smoking  cigarettes   
reported it made them think about quitting and  said it 
made them likely to try an ecigarette in the future The  
of  participants  who  had  used  ecigarettes  were  significantly 
more  likely  to  think  about  smoking  cigarettes  after  viewing 
the ad than nonusers  and  respectively suggesting 
that viewing an ecigarette commercial may induce thoughts 
about smoking and cue the urge to smoke

Prevalence
Awareness  of  ecigarettes  and  ecigarette  trial  have  at  least 
doubled among both adults and adolescents in several coun
tries  from    to    In  the  United  States  awareness 
is  more  prevalent  among  men  but  trying  ecigarettes  is 
more  prevalent  among  women Almost  the  same  percent  of 
European  Union  and  US  adult  respondents  to  national  sur
veys  reported  having  tried  ecigarettes    in    versus 
  in    respectively All  populationbased  studies 
of  adult  use  show  the  highest  rate  of  ecigarette  use  among 
current smokers followed by former smokers with little use 
among  nonsmokers  although  ecigarette  trial  and  use  rose 
in all of these categories Etter and Bullen followed up a 
sample of ecigarette users recruited from Web sites dedicated 
to ecigarettes and smoking cessation most  of whom 
were former smokers at baseline At the year follow up  
of former smokers who were daily ecigarette users at base
line relapsed to smoking cigarettes and almost all  of 

the former smokers using ecigarettes daily at baseline were 
still  using  ecigarettes  daily  at  followup  Among    dual 
users at baseline   had stopped smoking after  year 
The  epidemiological  populationbased  studies  indicate  that 
across countries ecigarettes are most commonly being used 
concurrently with conventional tobacco cigarettes dual use 
Consistent with marketing messages the most common rea
sons given for trying ecigarettes are for use in places where 
smoking is restricted to cut down on smoking and for help 
with quitting smoking

Choi  and  Forster  followed  up  a  cohort  of  Midwestern 
young adults mean age  years who had never used ecig
arettes from  to  and found that  of baseline 
current smokers  of baseline former smokers and  
of baseline nonsmokers reported having ever used ecigarettes 
at followup Those who believed at baseline that ecigarettes 
could  help  with  quitting  smoking  and  perceived  ecigarettes 
to be less harmful than cigarettes were more likely to report 
experimenting  with  ecigarettes  at  followup  adjusted  odds 
ratio OR   confidence interval CI  and 
adjusted OR   CI  respectively

Data  on  ecigarette  use  among  adolescents  are  more  lim
ited but like for adults show rapid increases in awareness and 
use in  countries United States Poland Latvia Finland and 
Korea with higher rates of trial and current use in European 
countries  than  the  United  States  or  Korea  In  Korea 
youth ever use of ecigarettes rose from  in  to  
in  and in the United States it rose from  in  
to  in  As with adult populationbased studies data

  ECigarettes A Scientific Review 

  

suggest  that  ecigarette  use  is  most  appealing  and  prevalent 
among youth who are also experimenting with or are current 
users of tobacco cigarettes Dual use with conventional ciga
rettes is the predominant pattern of ecigarette use  in US 
middle school students and  among US high school stu
dents in  These results indicate rapid market penetration 
of ecigarettes among youth with trial among US high school 
students  in  even higher than the  rate for 
adults  Despite a law prohibiting ecigarette sales to 
minors ecigarette use among Utah youth grades   and 
 tripled between  and  with youth  times more 
likely to report current ecigarette use than adults

Although dual use with cigarettes is high some youth exper
imenting with ecigarettes have never tried a tobacco cigarette 
which indicates that some youth are initiating use of nicotine 
an addictive drug with ecigarettes In   of middle 
school and  of high school ever ecigarette users reported 
never smoking conventional cigarettes Similarly in  in 
Korea  of students in grades  through  who had ever 
used  ecigarettes  had  never  smoked  a  cigarette  The  Utah 
Department of Health found that  of ever ecigarette users 
reported that they had never smoked conventional cigarettes

ECigarette EFluid and Vapor

Chemical Constituents
The  nicotine  content  of  the  cartridge  eliquid  from  some 
brands revealed poor concordance of labeled and actual nico
tine content Simulated ecigarette use revealed that indi
vidual  puffs  contained  from    to    g  nicotine  per  puff 
Assuming  a  high  nicotine  delivery  of    g  per  puff  it 
would  take    puffs  to  deliver  the    mg  nicotine  typically 
delivered by smoking a conventional cigarette A puff of the 
ecigarette with the highest nicotine content contained  of 
the nicotine contained in a puff of a conventional cigarette 
Actual  nicotine  delivery  from  an  ecigarette  would  likely 
be  affected  by  users  smoking  behavior An  analysis  of  UK 
brand  ecigarettes and the resulting aerosol demonstrated that 
across brands nicotine content of the eliquid in the cartridges 
was not significantly correlated with the amount found in the 

resulting  aerosol  indicating  differences  in  the  engineering 
characteristics  of  the  device  that  strongly  influence  nicotine 
delivery even with a consistent puffing protocol

Goniewicz  et  al  analyzed  the  aerosol  from    brands  of 
ecigarettes a conventional cigarette and a nicotine inhaler for 
toxic and carcinogenic compounds The levels of toxicants in 
the aerosol were  to  orders of magnitude lower than in ciga
rette smoke but higher than with a nicotine inhaler Table 

Kim and Shin analyzed the tobaccospecific nitrosamines 
NNN  NNK  and  NAT  and  total  tobaccospecific  nitrosa
mines in  refill fluids from   companies  in the Korean 
market  and  found  nearly  a  orderofmagnitude  variation 
in  tobaccospecific  nitrosamine  concentrations  with  total 
tobaccospecific nitrosamine concentration ranging from  
to  gmL

Cytotoxicity
Bahl et al screened  ecigarette refill fluids from  com
panies for cytotoxicity using  cell types human pulmonary 
fibroblasts  human  embryonic  stem  cells  and  mouse  neural 
stem  cells  Cytotoxicity  varied  among  products  from  highly 
toxic to low or no cytotoxicity The authors determined that 
nicotine did not cause cytotoxicity that some products were 
noncytotoxic  to  pulmonary  fibroblasts  but  cytotoxic  to  both 
types  of  stem  cells  and  that  cytotoxicity  was  related  to  the 
concentration  and  number  of  flavorings  used  The  finding 
that the stem cells  are more sensitive than the differentiated 
adult pulmonary fibroblasts cells suggests that adult lungs are 
probably  not  the  most  sensitive  system  to  assess  the  effects 
of  exposure  to  ecigarette  aerosol  These  findings  also  raise 
concerns about pregnant women who use ecigarettes or are 
exposed to secondhand ecigarette aerosol

In a study funded by the FlavorArt ecigarette liquid man
ufacturers  Romagna  et  al  compared  the  cytotoxicity  of 
aerosol  produced  from    nicotinecontaining  flavored   
tobacco  flavored  and    fruit  or  candied  flavored  brands  of 
ecigarette  liquid  with  smoke  from  a  conventional  cigarette 
using  embryonic  mouse  fibroblast  cells  Only  aerosol  from 
coffeeflavored eliquid produced a cytotoxic effect average 
 viability at  concentration of solution

Secondhand Exposure
Ecigarettes do not burn or smolder the way conventional cig
arettes do so they do not emit sidestream smoke however 
bystanders are exposed to aerosol exhaled by the user Schripp 
et  al  conducted  chamber  studies  in  which  subjects  used   
eliquids  mg nicotine apple flavor  mg nicotine apple 
flavor    mg  nicotine  tobacco  flavor  and    tobacco  ciga
rette and measured levels of several toxins and nicotine in the 
resulting aerosol Three ecigarette devices were used for these 
experiments  that used a tank system that is directly filled 
with eliquid and one that used a cartridge with a cotton fiber 
on which to drip the liquid They found low levels of form
aldehyde acetaldehyde isoprene acetic acid  butanodione 
acetone propanol propylene glycol and diacetin from flavor
ing traces of apple oil  methylbutylmethylbutanoate 
and nicotine with differing levels depending on the specific 
protocols emitted into the air Toxins in the ecigarette aero
sol were at much lower levels compared with the conventional 
cigarette emissions

In  another  chamber  study  Flouris  et  al  compared  emis
sions  of  conventional  cigarettes  and  ecigarettes  in  condi
tions designed to approximate a smoky bar target air CO of 
  ppm  using  machinesmoked  ecigarettes  and  cigarettes 
Ecigarette aerosol using a single brand of ecigarette made 
in Greece and a single eliquid with at least  propylene 
glycol  mgmL nicotine was generated with a pump that 
operated for the same duration as the cigarette smoking and 
aerosol was released into the room A person inhaling a nico
tine  aerosol  usually  absorbs    of  the  nicotine  whereas 
the pump discharges all nicotine into the environment so the 
nicotine exposure may be higher in this study than would be 
the  case  with  actual  secondhand  aerosol  exposure  Serum 
cotinine in nonsmokers sitting in the chamber was similar for 
cigarette  smoke  and  ecigarette  aerosol  exposure  average  
 ngmL for tobacco cigarette and  ngmL for ecigarette
Schober  et  al  measured  indoor  pollution  from    people 
using  ecigarettes  over  a  hour  period  in  a  realistic  envi
ronment  modeled  on  a  caf  They  found  elevated  nicotine

International Agency for Research on Cancer in the room air
Czogala et al conducted a chamber study of secondhand

tained fine particles PM with ecigarette aerosol particle 
concentrations  ranging  from    to    gm  Ecigarette 

aerosol was not a source of exposure to carbon monoxide a 
key combustion element of conventional cigarette smoke

Particulate Matter
Ecigarettes  deliver  nicotine  by  creating  an  aerosol  of  ultra
fine  particles  Fine  particles  can  be  variable  and  chemically 
complex and the specific components responsible for toxic
ity  and  the  relative  importance  of  particle  size  and  particle 
composition  are  generally  not  known  Given  these  uncer
tainties  it  is  not  clear  whether  the  ultrafine  particles  deliv
ered by ecigarettes have health effects and toxicity similar to 
the ambient fine particles generated by conventional cigarette 
smoke or secondhand smoke There is strong evidence how
ever that frequent low or shortterm levels of exposure to fine 
and ultrafine particles from tobacco smoke or air pollution can 
contribute to pulmonary and systemic inflammatory processes 
and increase the risk of cardiovascular and respiratory disease 
and death

Fuoco  et  al  examined  particle  number  concentration 
and  distribution  and  performed  a  volatility  analysis  of  the 
 ecigarette aerosol generated from  devices  rechargeable 
and  disposable using  refill eliquids with varying levels 
of  nicotine  and  flavorants  They  found  that  higher  eliquid 
nicotine content was associated with higher particle numbers 
in the resulting aerosol with little effect on the particle size 
distribution  Longer  puffing  time  resulted  in  more  particles 
Flavor  was  not  associated  with  differences  in  particle  num
ber  or  size  distribution  Consistent  with  other  studies 
the particle size distribution range of modes  nm 
was  similar  to  that  of  conventional  cigarettes  with  some 
 ecigarettes delivering more particles than conventional ciga
rettes Figure 

Zhang et al examined the size of ecigarette aerosol par
ticles and likely deposition in the human body using a single 
brand  BloogMaxXFusion  with  both  propylene  glycol  and 
vegetable glycerinbased liquids Using particle size and lung 
ventilation rates  for a reference worker and  for a heavy 
worker  and  mh respectively their human depo
sition  model  estimated  that    to    of  particles  would 
be  distributed  into  the  exhaled  aerosol  whereas    to   
of particles would be deposited in alveoli resulting in arterial 
delivery and  to  would be deposited in the head and 
airways resulting in venous delivery As expected the heavy 
worker  model  showed  more  alveolar  delivery  across  puffs 
compared  with  the  reference  worker  who  would  have  more 
head and airway delivery In total  to  of particles 
are  estimated  to  be  deposited  in  the  circulatory  system  and 
into organs from ecigarette aerosol which is comparable to 
the  to  for conventional cigarette smoke

In  their  study  of  passive  exposure  to  exhaled  ecigarette 
aerosol  in  a  simulated  caf  Schober  et  al  found  that  con
centrations of fine particles in the air increased from a median 
of    particles  per    cm  with  people  simply  sitting  in  the 
room for  hours to medians of   to   particles per 
 cm depending on the ecigarette fluid used after  hours of 
ecigarette use in the same room

metals tin nickel copper lead chromium Williams et al 
found  heavy  metals  in  samples  of  ecigarette  liquids  and 
aerosol Tin which appeared to originate from solder joints 
was found as both particles and tin whiskers in the fluid and 
Polyfil and ecigarette fluid containing tin was cytotoxic to 
human  pulmonary  fibroblasts  Ecigarette  aerosol  also  con
tained other metals including nickel  to  times higher 
than found in Marlboro cigarette smoke The nickel and chro
mium nanoparticles  nm possibly originated from the 
heating element It is likely that engineering features includ
ing the nature of the battery the heating temperature of the 
liquid  and  the  type  of  heating  element  and  reservoir  will 
influence the nature number and size of particles produced 
These  metal  nanoparticles  can  deposit  into  alveolar  sacs  in 
the  lungs  potentially  causing  local  respiratory  toxicity  and 
entering the bloodstream

In  summary  the  particle  size  distribution  and  number  of 
particles delivered by ecigarettes are similar to those of con
ventional cigarettes with most particles in the ultrafine range 
modes    nm  Particle  delivery  appears  to  depend 
on the nicotine level in the ecigarette fluid but not the pres
ence  of  flavors  Smokers  exhale  some  of  these  particles 
which exposes bystanders to passive vaping Like cigarettes 
 ecigarette particles are small enough to reach deep into the 

lungs and cross into the systemic circulation At a minimum 
these  studies  show  that  ecigarette  aerosol  is  not  merely 
water vapor as is often claimed in the marketing for these 
products  Tests  on  ecigarettes  show  much  lower  levels  of 
most toxicants but not particles than conventional cigarettes 
The  thresholds  for  human  toxicity  of  potential  toxicants  in 
 ecigarette vapor are not known and the possibility of health 
risks to primary users of the products and those exposed pas
sively to their emissions must be considered

Nicotine Absorption
Early  studies  of  nicotine  absorption  in    found  that 
 ecigarettes  delivered  much  lower  levels  of  plasma  nicotine 
than conventional cigarettes whereas a more recent study 
demonstrated  that  more  experienced  users  using  their  own 
product  who  engaged  in  more  puff  intervals  have  nicotine 
absorption  similar  to  that  with  conventional  cigarettes 
perhaps as a result of a combination of characteristics of the 
devices and user vaping topography Another study of smok
ers  smoking  ecigarettes  using  a  specified  protocol  found  a 
similar  rise  in  serum  cotinine  immediately  after  use  mean 
increase  ngmL Several studies reported that regard
less  of  nicotine  delivery  ecigarettes  can  modestly  alleviate 
some  symptoms  of  withdrawal  and  participants  positively

appraised  the  use  of  ecigarettes  In  a  study  comparing 
the nicotine inhalator and ecigarettes the nicotine inhalator 
delivered an amount of nicotine similar to that in the mg 
ecigarette  however  the  authors  noted  that  the  ecigarette 
malfunctioned  and  did  not  deliver  any  nicotine  in  a  third  of 
participants These results highlight the need for product regu
lation in terms of drug delivery and effects as well as device 
functioning and labeling

Health Effects
Propylene glycol and glycerin are the main base ingredients of 
the eliquid Exposure to propylene glycol can cause eye and 
respiratory  irritation  and  prolonged  or  repeated  inhalation 
in  industrial  settings  may  affect  the  central  nervous  system 
behavior and the spleen In its product safety materials Dow 
Chemical Company states that inhalation exposure to pro
pylene glycol mists should be avoided and the American 
Chemistry  Council  warns  against  its  use  in  theater  fogs 
because  of  the  potential  for  eye  and  respiratory  irritation 
When heated and vaporized propylene glycol can form pro
pylene oxide an International Agency for Research on Cancer 
class B carcinogen and glycerol forms acrolein which can 
cause upper respiratory tract irritation

Major  injuries  and  illness  have  resulted  from  ecigarette 
use including explosions and fires Less serious adverse 
events  include  throat  and  mouth  irritation  cough  nausea 
and vomiting

A  study  of  healthy  smokers  pulmonary  function  after 
acute ad lib puffing of an ecigarette Nobacco medium  
mg  for    minutes  after  refraining  from  smoking  tobacco 
cigarettes for  hours found no effect on spirometry but did 
find significantly increased dynamic airway resistance  
and  decreased  expired  nitric  oxide    Sham  ecigarette 
use had no significant effect This study is limited by the small 
sample size the short period of tobacco use abstinence before 
protocol execution the short length of exposure to ecigarette 
aerosol  and  the  lack  of  comparison  with  smoking  conven
tional  cigarettes  In  addition  smokers  in  general  have  high 
airway  resistance  with  dynamic  testing  and  lower  expired 
nitric oxide likely as a result of oxidant stress Despite these 
limitations this study suggests that ecigarette use constricts 
peripheral airways possibly as a result of the irritant effects 
of propylene glycol which could be of particular concern in 
people with chronic lung disease such as asthma emphysema 
or chronic bronchitis

Flouris et al assessed the shortterm effects of ecigarette 
use  on  pulmonary  function  in    cigarette  smokers  who 
puffed  an  ecigarette    propylene  glycol    mgmL 
nicotine  and  a  conventional  cigarette  according  to  a  speci
fied protocol and passive exposure to ecigarette aerosol and 
conventional cigarette smoke with  never smokers Active 
cigarette smoking resulted in a significant decrease in expired 
lung volume forced expiratory volume in the first second of 
expirationforced inspiratory vital capacity that was not seen 
with active ecigarette use or with passive tobacco cigarette or 
ecigarette exposure Additional analysis of the data collected 
in this study found that white cell count increased after ciga
rette  smoking  reflecting  inflammatory  processassociated 
risk for acute cardiovascular events Active ecigarette use and 

passive exposure to ecigarette vapor did not result in a sig
nificant increase in these biomarkers over  hour of exposure
Schober et al found elevated levels of exhaled nitric oxide 
in people using a nicotine ecigarette but not a  nicotinefree 
ecigarette  which  the  authors  attributed  to  pulmonary 
inflammation

National Vapers  Club  a  proecigarette  advocacy  group 
published a risk assessment of ecigarette and cigarette use 
that concluded that neither vapor from eliquids or cigarette 
smoke analytes posed a condition of significant risk of harm 
to human health via the inhalation route of exposure The 
authors failed to detect benzoapyrene in conventional ciga
rette smoke despite the fact that it is an established carcino
gen in cigarette smoke and their assessment of conventional 
cigarettes  concluded  that  they  did  not  pose  significant  risk 
both of which point to fatal errors in the data data analysis 
or both Another report funded by the Consumer Advocates 
for Smokefree Alternatives Association and published on the 
Internet  used  occupational  threshold  limit  values  to  evalu
ate the potential risk posed by several toxins in ecigarettes 
concluding  that  there  is  no  evidence  that  vaping  produces 
inhalable exposures to contaminants of the aerosol that would 
warrant  health  concerns  by  the  standards  that  are  used  to 
ensure  safety  of  workplaces  Threshold  limit  values  are  an 
approach to assessing health effects for occupational chemi
cal exposures that are generally much higher often orders of 
magnitude higher than levels considered acceptable for ambi
ent  or  populationlevel  exposures  Occupational  exposures 
also do not consider exposure to sensitive subgroups such as 
people  with  medical  conditions  children  and  infants  who 
might be exposed to secondhand ecigarette emissions most 
notably nicotine

In summary only a few studies have directly investigated 
the health effects of exposure to ecigarette aerosol but some 
demonstrate  the  ability  of  ecigarette  aerosol  exposure  to 
result  in  biological  effects  Longterm  biological  effects  are 
unknown  at  this  time  because  ecigarettes  have  not  been  in 
widespread use long enough for assessment

Effects on Cessation of Conventional Cigarettes
Ecigarettes  are  promoted  as  smoking  cessation  aids  and 
many individuals who use ecigarettes believe that they will 
help  them  quit  smoking  conventional  cigarettes  The 
assumption  that  ecigarettes  will  be  as  effective  as  or  more 
effective than pharmaceutical NRTs has also motivated sup
port  for  ecigarettes  among  some  public  health  researchers 
and policy makers and as discussed later formed the basis 
for some public policies on the regulation of ecigarettes

PopulationBased Studies
There  are    longitudinal  studies  and    crosssectional 
study of the association between ecigarette use and quitting 
conventional cigarettes Table 

Adkison  et  al  studied  current  and  former  smokers  in  the 
International  Tobacco  Control  study  in  the  United  States 
Canada  the  United  Kingdom  and Australia  at  baseline  and 
 year later and found that ecigarette users had a statistically 
significant greater reduction in cigarettes per day ecigarette 
users  to  cigarettes per day nonusers  to

The  main  reason  for  ecigarette  use  was  tobacco  cessation 
 but it is not known whether ever use occurred as part 
of a quit attempt in the preceding  months Although quitline 
callers represent a small population of smokers motivated to 
quit these data present a realworld estimate of the potential 
effectiveness of using ecigarettes for cessation in a popula
tion of smokers motivated to quit Although this study had a 
low response rate  and may be subject to recall bias 
because ecigarette use and perceptions were assessed only at 
the month followup those who reported using ecigarettes 
were  statistically  significantly  less  likely  to  quit  than  those 
who had not used ecigarettes  among callers who used 
for    month    among  those  who  used  for    month

Combining these results in a randomeffects metaanalysis 
Table    yields  a  pooled  OR  of      CI   
indicating that ecigarette use in the real world is associated 
with significantly lower odds of quitting smoking cigarettes 
A limitation of  of these studies is that they did not con
trol for level of nicotine dependence It is possible that more 
dependent smokers who would have more difficulty quitting 
in  general  would  be  the  ones  who  would  be  more  likely  to 
experiment  with  ecigarettes  which  could  contribute  to  the 
finding that ecigarette use is associated with a lower quit rate

Clinical Trials
Four  clinical  trials    with  very  small  samples  examined 
the efficacy of ecigarettes for smoking cessation Three 
trials  did  not  have  a  control  group  who  were  not  using 
ecigarettes The other study compared ecigarette efficacy 
to  a  standardofcare  regimen  with  a  mg  nicotine  patch 
None  of  the  trials  were  conducted  with  the  level  of  behav
ioral support that accompanies most pharmaceutical trials for 
smoking cessation

Polosa et al conducted a proofofconcept study in Italy in 
 with smokers to  years of age not intending to quit in 
the next  days Subjects were offered Categoria ecigarettes 
and instructed to use up to  cartridges mg nicotine con
tent per day as desired to reduce smoking and to keep a log 
of cigarettes per day cartridges per day and adverse events 
Sixmonth followup was completed with  of participants 
 of   were using both ecigarettes and tobacco ciga

  stopped  using  tobacco  cigarettes  while  continuing  to  use 
ecigarettes  Cigarette  consumption  was  reduced  by  at  least 
  in  the    dual  users    cigarettes  per  day  at  baseline 
to  cigarettes per day at  months P Polosa et al 
continued followup of this sample at  and  months with 
 subjects  of the original  enrolled Among the  
participants who completed a month visit  continued to 
smoke and  had reduced cigarette consumption by  
with a statistically significant reduction from an average of  
to  cigarettes per day P Five participants had quit 
tobacco  cigarettes  at    months  Study  limitations  included 
the use of a poorquality product and the lack of a comparison 
or control group which could make it difficult to determine 
whether quit rates achieved were not due to chance

Caponnetto et al conducted a similar study with  smok
ers with schizophrenia not intending to quit in the next  days 
Participants  were  provided  the  same  Categoria   ecigarette 
and  carbon  monoxide  product  use  number  of  cigarettes 
smoked and positive and negative symptoms of schizophre
nia were assessed at baseline and     and  weeks 
Seven of  participants  sustained a  reduction in 
the number of cigarettes per day smoked at week  and the 
median of  cigarettes per day decreased to  cigarettes per 
day P Sustained abstinence from smoking occurred 
with    participants    by  week    Positive  and  nega
tive aspects of schizophrenia were not increased after smok
ing  cessation  The  most  common  outcome  was  dual  use  of 
ecigarettes  with  conventional  cigarettes  Study  findings  are 
not  generalizable  to  smokers  with  mental  illness  because  of 
the very small sample size and lack of a control group

Caponnetto  et  al  also  conducted  a 

randomized 
 quasicontrolled trial to examine the efficacy of ecigarettes 
of different strengths for smoking cessation and reduction in 
 study arms  weeks of treatment with the mg nicotine 
ecigarette a week nicotinetapering regimen  weeks of 
treatment with a mg ecigarette and  weeks with a  mg 
ecigarette  and  a  week  treatment  with  a  nonnicotine 
ecigarette  Similar  reductions  in  the  median  cigarettes  per 
day were seen at all study visits for all  treatment arms  
cigarettes per day at  year There was no statistically sig
nificant difference in month or year quit rate among the  
conditions year rates  for placebo ecigarette users  
for lownicotine ecigarette users and  for highnicotine 
ecigarette users The authors noted that those who initiated 
quitting  in  the  first  few  weeks  of  the  study  stayed  quitters 
whereas  those  who  did  not  remained  dual  users  throughout 
the  study  Twentysix  percent  of  quitters  continued  to  use 
ecigarettes  at    year  Problems  with  the  study  include  the 
lack of a control group not using ecigarettes and noted lack 
of product quality the devices malfunctioned often and new 

ones  had  to  be  sent  frequently  An  author  on  all  of  these 
studies R Polosa served as a consultant for the Arbi Group 
SRL  the  manufacturer  of  the  Categoria  ecigarette  used  in 
the study beginning in February 

Bullen  et  al  conducted  a  randomized  controlled  clini
cal  trial  of  ecigarettes  compared  with  medicinal  NRT  in 
Auckland  New  Zealand  Adult  smokers  motivated  to  quit 
were  randomized  to  the    study  arms  mg  ecigarette 
mg  NRT  patch  nonicotine  ecigarette  Voluntary  tele
phone  counseling  was  offered  to  all  subjects  Subjects  were 
observed  at  baseline    week  quit  day    weeks  and   
months  Fiftyseven  percent  of  participants  in  the  nicotine 
ecigarettes group reduced their cigarettes per day by  
at  months compared with  in the patch group P 
and  in the nonnicotine ecigarette group P Those 
randomized to the nicotine patch group were less adherent to 
the treatment  than the mg ecigarette group  
and  the  nonicotine  ecigarette  group    Of  note  the 
study methodology may have introduced bias against success 
in the nicotine patch group because ecigarettes were mailed 
for free directly to participants randomized to either the nico
tine or nonicotine ecigarette group whereas participants in 
the  patch  group  were  mailed  cards  redeemable  for  nicotine 
patches at a pharmacy and vouchers to cover the modest fee 
Therefore  although  the  protocol  for  providing  the  patches 
represented  usual  care  for  New  Zealand  quitline  callers 
this procedure may have introduced bias against NRT making 
it difficult to view the study as a headtohead comparison of 
ecigarettes and NRT for cessation There were no statistically 
significant  differences  in  biochemically  confirmed  breath 
CO selfreported continuous abstinence from quit day to the 
month  followup  between  the  nicotine  ecigarette   
nicotine patch  and nonnicotine ecigarette 

Neither Capponnetto et al nor Bullen et al found effects 
of ecigarette use on quitting beyond what is seen in unassisted 
or lowassistance studies of smokers using NRT to quit In 
determining the effectiveness of smoking cessation therapy 
active drug is considered efficacious when it outperforms pla
cebo therefore the evidence to date from clinical trials does 
not demonstrate that ecigarettes are efficacious for cessation 
However  it  is  possible  that  ecigarettes  even  without  nico
tine act as substitutes for the sensory and behavioral effects 
of conventional cigarettes If this is the case the nonnicotine 
placebo ecigarette would be considered an active treatment 
condition  and  as  discussed  previously  has  been  shown  to 
reduce  withdrawal  symptoms  Important  limitations 
of  the  current  research  include  the  use  of  ecigarettes  that 
deliver relatively low levels of nicotine and the provision of 
minimal  behavioral  counseling  Another  important  limita
tion of studies assessing the effectiveness of ecigarettes for 
smoking cessation is that because they are not approved as 
cessation  therapy  there  are  no  therapeutic  instructions  for 
using  them  as  replacements  or  to  quit  smoking  eg  dosage 
tapering duration of use how to combine them with behav
ioral strategies guidance for discontinuation

In contrast to the assumption that ecigarettes would func
tion  as  a  better  form  of  NRT  populationbased  studies  that 
reflect realworld ecigarette use found that ecigarette use is 
not  associated  with  successful  quitting  all  had  point

estimates of the odds of quitting of  The  clinical trial 
examining  the  effectiveness  of  ecigarettes  both  with  and 
without nicotine compared with the medicinal nicotine patch 
found  that  ecigarettes  are  no  better  than  the  nicotine  patch 
and that all treatments produced very modest quit rates with
out  counseling  Taken  together  these  studies  suggest  that 
ecigarettes are not associated with successful quitting in gen
eral populationbased samples of smokers

Health Implications of Cigarette 
Reduction in the Context of Dual Use
Among adults reductions in cigarettes per day were observed 
in several of the clinical studies and in  populationbased 
study among those who did not quit Reduction in cigarettes 
smoked per day could have benefit if it promotes subsequent 
cessation as has been found with NRT but this pattern has 
not yet been seen with ecigarettes In the cigarette reduction 
analyses presented in some of the studies many participants 
were still smoking about half a pack cigarettes per day at the 
end of the study

Both duration years of cigarette use and intensity ciga
rettes per day determine the negative health effects of smok
ing People who stop smoking at younger ages have lower 
ageadjusted mortality compared with those who continued to 
smoke later into adulthood Findings for decreased smoking 
intensity have been less consistent with some studies showing 
lower  mortality  with  reduced  daily  cigarette  consumption 
and others not finding a significant overall survival benefit 
The    report  of  the  US  Surgeon  General  concluded  that 
reducing the number of cigarettes smoked per day is much 
less  effective  than  quitting  entirely  for  avoiding  the  risks  of 
premature death from all smokingrelated causes of death 
Use of electronic cigarettes by cigarette smokers to cut down 
on the number of cigarettes smoked per day is likely to have 
much smaller beneficial effects on overall survival compared 
with quitting smoking completely

This  situation  is  particularly  likely  to  exist  for  cardiovas
cular  disease  because  of  the  highly  nonlinear  doseresponse 
relationship between exposure to fine particles and the risk of 
cardiovascular  disease  Light  smoking  even    to    ciga
rettes per day is associated with markedly elevated risk of car
diovascular disease In addition ecigarettes deliver loads of 
fine particles similar to those of conventional cigarettes

The relative risk of death from lung cancer increases with 
years smoked and cigarettes per day as well as pancreatic 
cancer  and  esophageal  cancer  The  relative  risk  of  both 
lung cancer and bladder cancer levels off after a certain num
ber  of  cigarettes  per  day  suggesting  that  above  a  certain 
intensity the specific levels of exposure may not cause sig
nificant differences in risk for these cancers Doll and Peto 
found  a  doseresponse  relationship  between  duration  of 
smoking and number of cigarettes smoked per day and risk 
of lung cancer with models suggesting the impact of dura
tion  to  be  greater  than  that  of  intensity  Using  participants 
from the Cancer Prevention Study II Flanders et al found a 
greater increase in lung cancer mortality with a greater dura
tion of cigarette smoking compared with a greater intensity 
of smoking Overall these data suggest that lung cancer mor
tality increases more with additional years of smoking than 

additional cigarettes per day Thus if dual use of ecigarettes 
and  cigarettes  results  in  reductions  in  the  number  of  ciga
rettes per day for current smokers any reduction malignancy 
risk  will  be  less  than  proportional  to  the  reduction  in  ciga
rette  consumption  because  of  the  likely  larger  importance 
of duration of smoking

What to Tell Patients About 
ECigarettes and Cessation
First and foremost clinicians must support a smokers quit 
attempt  and  try  to  ensure  any  that  advice  given  does  not 
undermine their motivation to quit Clinicians should follow 
the   As  of  evidencebased  treatment  ask  advise  assess 
assist  and  arrange  They  should  assess  their  patients 
motivation and readiness to quit and recommend a treatment 
plan that should include setting a quit date and obtaining ces
sation counseling and if appropriate conventional smoking 
cessation medications The safest and most proven smoking 
cessation  pharmacotherapies  are  the  nicotine  replacement 
medications  varenicline  and  bupropion  which  have  been 
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration FDA 
Referral to a free telephone quit line eg QUITNOW 
or another counseling support program enhances the effec
tiveness of smoking cessation medications 

If a patient has failed initial treatment has been intolerant of 
or refuses to use conventional smoking cessation medication 
and wishes to use ecigarettes to aid quitting it is reasonable 
to support the attempt However subjects should be informed 
that  although  ecigarette  aerosol  is  likely  to  be  much  less 
toxic  than  cigarette  smoking  the  products  are  unregulated 
contain toxic chemicals and have not been proven as cessa
tion  devices  The  patient  should  also  be  advised  not  to  use 
the product indoors or around children because studies show 
that bystanders may be exposed to nicotine and other toxins 
at levels much lower than cigarettes through passive expo
sure to the ecigarette aerosol Because there are no longterm 
safety studies of ecigarette use patients should be urged to 
set a quit date for their ecigarette use and not plan to use it 
indefinitely It is also important to stress that patients should 
quit smoking cigarettes entirely as soon as possible because 
continued cigarette smoking even at reduced levels contin
ues  to  impose  tobaccoinduced  health  risks  particularly  for 
cardiovascular disease

Tobacco Industry and Involvement
By    the  major  tobacco  companies  had  purchased  or 
developed ecigarette products Table 

There  is  no  evidence  that  the  cigarette  companies  are 
acquiring  or  producing  ecigarettes  as  part  of  a  strategy  to 
phase out regular cigarettes even though some claim to want 
to  participate  in  harm  reduction  Lorillard  CEO  Murray 
Kessler stated in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that 
ecigarettes will provide smokers an unprecedented chance to 
reduce their risk from cigarettes He also published an oped 
in USA Today on September   stating Ecigarettes 
might  be  the  most  significant  harmreduction  option  ever 
made available to smokers Shortly before this oped was 
published  however  Lorillard  won  approval  from  the  US 
FDA  to  market  new  nonmentholated  Newport  conventional

cigarettes  expanding  their  cigarette  line  while  touting  their 
ability to offer a product they claim reduces harm from cig
arettes  This  allows  the  cigarette  companies  to  have  it  both 
ways  Likewise  after  evaluating  the  cigarette  companies 
internal  documents  and  public  positions  on  snus  a  form  of 
moist snuff tobacco in a pouch popular in Sweden as harm 
reduction  in  Europe  Gilmore  et  al  found  that  they  were 
entering  the  snus  market  and  adopting  harm  reduction 
rhetoric  to  protect  their  cigarette  business  as  long  as  pos
sible As noted in the  Surgeon Generals report the 
tobacco industry has used every iteration of cigarette design 
to undermine cessation and prevention

The tobacco companies address ecigarette issues as part of 
their policy agenda As they did beginning in the s 
they  continue  to  engage  in  creating  and  supporting  smok
ers  rights  groups  seemingly  independent  groups  that 
interact with consumers directly on political involvement in 
support of their agenda Altria and RJ Reynolds Tobacco 
Company  maintain  Web  sites  called  Citizens  for  Tobacco 
Rights and Transform Tobacco Ecigarette news and action 
alerts are featured on the home pages of these websites and 
include  instructions  for  taking  action  against  bills  designed 
to  include  ecigarette  use  in  smokefree  laws  Ecigarette 
companies  engage  in  similar  tactics  using  the  same  politi
cal and public relations strategies as the tobacco companies 
most notably featuring organized vapers like the organized 
smokers They also use social media that is tightly integrated 
with  their  product  marketing  campaigns  to  press  their  pol
icy  agenda  These  strategies  were  successfully  deployed 
in  Europe  to  convince  the  European  Parliament  to  substan
tially weaken the proposed EU Tobacco Product Directive in 
October 

Current State of Global 
Regulation March 
Like  ecigarette  products  the  policy  environment  related  to 
ecigarettes is rapidly developing despite the fact that the sci
ence  is  just  emerging  Policy  makers  in  many  countries  are 
under  considerable  pressure  to  provide  regulatory  guidance 
regarding ecigarettes often on the basis of the assumption that 
ecigarettes will contribute to reducing the harms of smoking 
either by serving as a smoking cessation aid or by replacing 
combusted cigarettes The data reviewed here together with 
evidence of dual use and youth initiation of ecigarette use do 
not demonstrate any hypothesized harmreducing effect

Some  countries  including  Brazil  Singapore  Canada 
the  Seychelles  and  Uruguay  have  prohibited  the  sale  of 
 ecigarettes  and  many  others  are  developing  policies  The 
United  States  European  Union  and  United  Kingdom  illus
trate the range of regulatory approaches being developed

The United States
In  the  United  States  as  of  March    ecigarette  products 
remained unregulated by any federal authority particularly the 
US FDA The Sottera Inc case ruling that was upheld on appeal 
in the US court found that ecigarettes could be regulated as 
tobacco  products  unless  they  are  marketed  with  health  and 
therapeutic claims The US FDA has stated its intent to assert 
deem authority over ecigarettes but has yet to act The US 
FDA does not have the authority to regulate where ecigarettes 
are  used  that  is  the  domain  of  state  and  local  governments 
where almost all activity on smokefree laws has occurred 

Since  ecigarettes  entered  the  US  market  in    there 
has been a rapid increase in the number of municipalities and 
states  that  have  adopted  legislation  regulating  where  eciga
rettes can be used and laws restricting sales to minors As of 
March      states  had  laws  restricting  sales  to  minors 
  state  Minnesota  taxed  ecigarettes  as  tobacco  products 
and    states  New  Jersey  North  Dakota  and  Utah  and 
 municipalities including New York Los Angeles San 
Francisco and Chicago prohibited the use of ecigarettes in 
   smokefree  indoor  environments  An  additional   
states  restricted  ecigarettes  in  other  venues  such  as  school 
district  property  Department  of  Correctionsprisons  public 
educational facilities and grounds and commuter transit sys
tems  Some  local  and  statewide  smokefree  laws  enacted 
before  the  introduction  of  ecigarettes  include  language  that 
could be interpreted as including ecigarettes

European Union Tobacco Product Directive
In  February    the  European  Parliament  approved  a 
revised European Union Tobacco Product Directive that regu
lates ecigarettes with nicotine concentrations up to  mgmL 
an  amount  equal  to  that  in  a  pack  of  cigarettes  as  tobacco 
products  Ecigarettes  with  higher  nicotine  concentrations 
or  intended  therapeutic  uses  will  be  regulated  as  medical 
devices  The  directive  stipulates  that  ecigarettes  must  be 
childproof and that packaging must include information about 
ingredients adverse effects and health warnings Refillable 
cartridges are allowed as long as their volume does not exceed 
 mL but could be banned by the European Commission if 
at least  member states prohibit them on the basis of risks to 
human health Marketing and advertising restrictions will 
mirror those of tobacco products

The United Kingdom
In the United Kingdom the Medicines and Healthcare Products 
Regulatory Agency announced a plan to regulate ecigarettes as 
medicines on the basis of the assumption that ecigarettes func
tion like NRTs for smokers wishing to cut down or quit As of 
January  Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory 
Agency policies did not include any restrictions on  ecigarette 
marketing  The  antismoking  advocacy  group  Action  on 
Smoking  and  Health  UK  has  announced  that  it  does  not

consider it appropriate to include ecigarettes under smokefree 
regulations  supporting  one  of  the  ecigarette  companies 
key  marketing  messages  that  ecigarettes  can  be  used  every
where without the restrictions and social stigma of smoking

Policy Recommendations
Ecigarettes deliver lower levels of some of the toxins found 
in  cigarette  smoke  Main  concerns  about  the  potential  of 
ecigarettes  to  make  a  contribution  to  reducing  the  harm 
caused by cigarette smoking arise from effects on youth dual 
use  with  cigarettes  resulting  in  delayed  or  deferred  quitting 
among both adults and youth and renormalization of smok
ing behavior

The  ultimate  effect  of  ecigarettes  on  public  health  will 
depend  on  what  happens  in  the  policy  environment  These 
policies should be implemented to protect public health

	 Prohibit the use of ecigarettes anywhere that use of con

ventional cigarettes is prohibited

	 Prohibit  the  sale  of  ecigarettes  to  anyone  who  cannot 
legally buy cigarettes or in any venues where sale of con
ventional cigarettes is prohibited

	 Subject ecigarette marketing to the same level of restric
tions that apply to conventional cigarettes including no 
television or radio advertising

	 Prohibit  cobranding  ecigarettes  with  cigarettes  or  mar

keting in a way that promotes dual use

	 Prohibit the use of characterizing flavors in ecigarettes 

particularly candy and alcohol flavors

	 Prohibit  claims  that  ecigarettes  are  effective  smoking 
cessation  aids  until  ecigarette  manufacturers  and  com
panies provide sufficient evidence that ecigarettes can be 
used effectively for smoking cessation

	 Prohibit any health claims for ecigarette products until 
and unless approved by regulatory agencies to scientific 
and regulatory standards

	 Establish  standards  for  regulating  product  ingredients 

and functioning

In  addition  to  being  important  in  their  own  right  should 
these policies be put in place together with polices designed 
to make combustible tobacco products eg cigarettes cigars 
cigarillos less desirable and available it is possible that cur
rent conventional cigarette smokers who will not quit nicotine 
would  shift  to  ecigarettes  without  major  dual  use  or  youth 
initiation  to  nicotine  addiction  with  ecigarettes  Absent 
this  change  in  the  policy  environment  it  is  reasonable  to 
assume  that  the  behavior  patterns  that  have  been  observed 
for   ecigarettes  will  persist  which  makes  it  unlikely  that 
they will contribute to reducing the harm of tobacco use and 
could increase harm by perpetuating the life of conventional 
cigarettes

Conclusions
Although most of the discussion of ecigarettes among health 
authorities has concentrated on the product itself its potential 
toxicity and use of ecigarettes to help people quit smoking 
the ecigarette companies have been rapidly expanding using 
aggressive marketing messages similar to those used to promote 
cigarettes in the s and s Ecigarette advertising is on 

television and radio in many countries that have long banned 
similar advertising for cigarettes and other tobacco products 
and may be indirectly promoting smoking conventional cig
arettes Although  it  is  reasonable  to  assume  that  if  existing 
smokers  switched  completely  from  conventional  cigarettes 
with no other changes in use patterns to ecigarettes there 
would be a lower disease burden caused by nicotine addiction 
the  evidence  available  at  this  time  although  limited  points 
to  high  levels  of  dual  use  of   ecigarettes  with  conventional 
cigarettes no proven cessation benefits and rapidly increas
ing  youth  initiation  with  ecigarettes Although  some  cite  a 
desire to quit smoking by using the ecigarette other common 
reasons for using the products are to circumvent smokefree 
laws and to cut down on conventional cigarettes which may 
reinforce dual use patterns and delay or deter quitting

The trajectory of the dual use pattern among adults or chil
dren is unclear but studies of youth find that as many as one 
third of youth who use ecigarettes have never smoked a con
ventional  cigarette  Nicotine  is  a  highly  addictive  substance 
with negative effects on animal and human brain development 
which is still ongoing in adolescence Furthermore high 
rates of dual use may result in greater total public health bur
den and possibly increased individual risk if a smoker main
tains an even lowlevel tobacco cigarette addiction for many 
years instead of quitting

Although data are limited it is clear that ecigarette emissions 
are not merely harmless water vapor as is frequently claimed 
and can be a source of indoor air pollution Smokefree poli
cies protect nonsmokers from exposure to toxins and encourage 
smoking cessation One hundred percent smokefree policies 
have larger effects on consumption and smoking prevalence 
as well as hospital admissions for myocardial infarction stroke 
and  other  cardiovascular  and  pulmonary  emergencies  than 
weaker  policies  Introducing  ecigarettes  into  clean  air  envi
ronments may result in population harm if use of the product 
reinforces  the  act  of  smoking  as  socially  acceptable  or  if  use 
undermines the benefits of smokefree policies
