Abstract
Background: The smoking epidemic inAustralia is characterised by historic levels of prolonged smoking, heavy
smoking, very high levels oflong-term cessation, and low current smoking prevalence, with13% of adults reporting
that they smoked daily in2013. Large-scale quantitative evidence on therelationship oftobaccosmoking to
mortality inAustralia is not available despite thepotentialto provideindependent international evidence about the
contemporary risks of smoking.
Methods: This is a prospective study of 204,953 individuals aged ≥45 years sampled from the general population
ofNew South Wales, Australia,who joined the 45 and Up Study from 2006–2009,with linked questionnaire,
hospitalisation, and mortality data to mid-2012 and with no history of cancer (other than melanoma and
non-melanoma skin cancer), heart disease, stroke, or thrombosis. Hazard ratios (described here as relative risks, RRs)
for all-cause mortality among current and past smokers compared to never-smokers were estimated, adjusting for
age, education, income, region of residence, alcohol, and body mass index.
Results: Overall, 5,593deaths accrued during follow-up(874,120person-years; mean: 4.26 years); 7.7% of
participants were current smokers and 34.1%past smokers at baseline. Compared to never-smokers, theadjusted
RR(95% CI) of mortality was 2.96 (2.69–3.25) incurrentsmokers and was similarin men(2.82 (2.49–3.19)) and
women (3.08 (2.63–3.60)) and according to birth cohort. Mortality RRsincreased with increasing smoking intensity,
witharoundtwo- and four-fold increases inmortality incurrent smokers of≤14 (mean 10/day) and ≥25
cigarettes/day, respectively,comparedto never-smokers. Among past smokers, mortality diminished gradually with
increasing time since cessation and did notdiffer significantly from never-smokers inthose quitting prior to age 45.
Current smokers are estimatedto die an average of10 years earlier than non-smokers.
Conclusions: In Australia, upto two-thirds of deaths incurrent smokers can be attributed to smoking. Cessation
reduces mortality compared withcontinuing to smoke, with cessation earlierinlife resulting in greater reductions.

Background
The risks of cancer, cardiovascular disease, respiratory
disease,andarangeofotherhealthproblemsareincreased
in tobacco smokers and, as a consequence, smokers are
more likely than non-smokers to die prematurely [1].
Smoking is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality
in virtually every country in the world and is second
only to high blood pressure as a risk factor for global
disease burden [2]. It is arguably the leading readily
preventable factor.
The relative risks of adverse health effects increase
with increasing intensity of smoking, measured by the
amount of tobacco smoked per day, and with increasing
duration of smoking [3]. Smoking cessation imparts sig-
nificant health benefits [3]. The overall effects of smo-
king on mortality in a population relate closely to the
prevalence of current and past smoking and to the dur-
ation and intensity of smoking, among smokers. These
indices relate, in turn, to the factors influencing smoking
behaviour, including the stage of the smoking epidemic
in the population under examination, to the relative
success of tobacco control measures and to cultural and
socioeconomicfactors.
Hence, both the relative risks of mortality and the
overall population impacts of smoking are not uniform
across the world and may also vary across time, popula-
tion groups, and birth cohorts within a single location
[3-5]. Large-scale quantitative evidence on the relation-
ship of tobacco smoking to mortality among countries
