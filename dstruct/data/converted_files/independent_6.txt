Abstract

Background The smoking epidemic in Australia is characterised by historic levels of prolonged smoking heavy
smoking very high levels of longterm cessation and low current smoking prevalence with  of adults reporting
that they smoked daily in  Largescale quantitative evidence on the relationship of tobacco smoking to
mortality in Australia is not available despite the potential to provide independent international evidence about the
contemporary risks of smoking
Methods This is a prospective study of  individuals aged  years sampled from the general population
of New South Wales Australia who joined the  and Up Study from  with linked questionnaire
hospitalisation and mortality data to mid and with no history of cancer other than melanoma and
nonmelanoma skin cancer heart disease stroke or thrombosis Hazard ratios described here as relative risks RRs
for allcause mortality among current and past smokers compared to neversmokers were estimated adjusting for
age education income region of residence alcohol and body mass index

Results Overall  deaths accrued during followup  personyears mean  years  of
participants were current smokers and  past smokers at baseline Compared to neversmokers the adjusted
RR  CI of mortality was   in current smokers and was similar in men   and
women   and according to birth cohort Mortality RRs increased with increasing smoking intensity
with around two and fourfold increases in mortality in current smokers of  mean day and 
cigarettesday respectively compared to neversmokers Among past smokers mortality diminished gradually with
increasing time since cessation and did not differ significantly from neversmokers in those quitting prior to age 
Current smokers are estimated to die an average of  years earlier than nonsmokers
Conclusions In Australia up to twothirds of deaths in current smokers can be attributed to smoking Cessation
reduces mortality compared with continuing to smoke with cessation earlier in life resulting in greater reductions

Background
The risks of cancer cardiovascular disease respiratory
disease and a range of other health problems are increased
in tobacco smokers and as a consequence smokers are
more likely than nonsmokers to die prematurely 
Smoking is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality
in virtually every country in the world and is second
only to high blood pressure as a risk factor for global
disease burden  It is arguably the leading readily
preventable factor

The relative risks of adverse health effects increase
with increasing intensity of smoking measured by the
amount of tobacco smoked per day and with increasing
duration of smoking  Smoking cessation imparts sig
nificant health benefits  The overall effects of smo
king on mortality in a population relate closely to the
prevalence of current and past smoking and to the dur
ation and intensity of smoking among smokers These
indices relate in turn to the factors influencing smoking
behaviour including the stage of the smoking epidemic
in the population under examination to the relative
success of tobacco control measures and to cultural and
socioeconomic factors

Hence both the relative risks of mortality and the
overall population impacts of smoking are not uniform
across the world and may also vary across time popula
tion groups and birth cohorts within a single location
 Largescale quantitative evidence on the relation
ship of tobacco smoking to mortality among countries
with a mature smoking epidemic is accruing but is not
yet available for Australia In common with many coun
tries Australia has relied on the findings from studies
including the British
conducted in the UK and US
Doctors Study  and the American Cancer Society
Cancer Prevention Studies  to underpin estimation
of the population impact of smoking  As well as
providing local evidence largescale data from Australia
have the potential to contribute to knowledge inter
nationally by providing additional independent data on
the effects of prolonged heavy and widespread smok
ing Furthermore Australia has been among the most
successful nations regarding tobacco control with most
recent data indicating that  of adults in Australia
reported daily smoking in   data from Australia
are therefore likely to provide insights into the risks of
smoking in settings with high historical prevalence of
smoking and low current prevalence Figure 

This study aims to investigate the relationship of smo
king to allcause mortality in Australia in the  and Up

been used in analyses from other countries these were
not available for Australia at the time of writing Partic

Methods
The Sax Institutes  and Up Study is an Australian co
hort study of  men and women aged  and over
randomly sampled from the general population of New
South Wales NSW Australia Individuals joined the
study by completing a postal questionnaire distributed
from  January  to  December  and giving
informed consent for followup through repeated data
collection and linkage of their data to population health

of the  diagnostic fields in the  years prior to com
pleting the baseline  and Up Study questionnaire

Baseline questionnaire data included information on
sociodemographic factors health behaviours height
and body weight medical and surgical history functional
capacity and physical activity The study questionnaire
is available online  To provide data to allow correc
tion for regression dilution repeat data on smoking sta
tus were taken from a resurvey of a sample of 
participants a mean of  years after recruitment

Questionnaire data from study participants were linked
probabilistically to data from the NSW Register of Births
Deaths and Marriages up to  June  to provide data
on fact and date of death This probabilistic matching is
known to be highly accurate falsepositive and false
negative rates   Death registrations capture all
deaths in NSW Cause of death information was not avail
able at the time of analysis In order to conduct sensitivity
analyses questionnaire data were also linked probabilistic
ally to data from the NSW Admitted Patient Data Collec
tion which is a complete census of all public and private
hospital admissions in NSW The linked data that were
used contained details of admissions in participants from
the year  up to the point of recruitment including
the primary reason for admission using the International
Classification of Diseases th revision  Australian Modi
fication ICDAM  and up to  additional clinical
diagnoses

Statistical methods
There were  participants with valid data on age
and date of recruitment Participants with data linkage
errors n    age below  years at baseline
n    and missing or invalid data on smoking
status n    were excluded To minimise the
potential impact of changes in smoking behaviour and
higher mortality in those with baseline illness also
known as reverse causality or the sick quitter effect
participants with a selfreported history of doctor
diagnosed cancer other than melanoma andor non
melanoma skin cancer n    and those with
a history of cardiovascular disease at baseline defined as
selfreported doctordiagnosed heart disease stroke or
blood clot on the baseline questionnaire n  
 were excluded from this study It was not possible
individuals with respiratory illness be
to exclude all
cause this information was not available in an appropri
ate form from the baseline questionnaire However
sensitivity analyses were conducted to investigate the
impact on the main results of additional exclusion of
individuals with a history of admission to hospital with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or other respira
tory illnesses defined as an admission to hospital with
ICDAM diagnosis codes J to J and J in any

Smoking status was classified according to the re
sponses to the following series of items on the baseline
questionnaire Have you ever been a regular smoker If
Yes how old were you when you started smoking
regularly Are you a smoker now If not how old were
you when you stopped smoking regularly About how
much do youdid you smoke on average each day
Neversmokers were participants who answered No to
the question Have you ever been a regular smoker
current smokers were those who answered Yes to this
question and Yes to being a smoker now and past
smokers were those who indicated that they had ever
been a regular smoker but who indicated that they were
not a smoker now The age at ceasing smoking among
past smokers was taken as the age they indicated they
stopped smoking regularly and was categorised as 
   and  years Among current
and past smokers the number of cigarettes smoked per
day was taken from the answer to the question about
how much they smoked on average each day and was
categorised as   and  cigarettesday

Mortality rates since baseline and  confidence in
tervals CIs were calculated for participants who report
ed being current past and neversmokers at baseline
these were indirectly standardised for age to the person

and were presented separately for men and women Haz
ard ratios which are equivalent to and described here

smokers who had ceased smoking  or fewer years prior
to baseline

Among current and neversmokers at recruitment
mortality rates and RRs by amount smoked were calcu
lated according to categories of consumption reported at
recruitment   and  cigarettesday Mor
tality rates were then plotted against the mean number
of cigarettes within each category reported at the year
resurvey among those who reported being current smokers

longterm mean consumption among all in that category

quantified among past versus neversmokers
ceasing smoking at ages    and 
years Sensitivity analyses were conducted restricting the
data to individuals aged  years ensuring that all partic
ipants had the opportunity to quit at these ages

The proportionality assumption of the Cox regression
models was verified by plotting the Schoenfeld residuals
against the time variable in each model with a stratified
form or timedependent form of the model used where
covariates displayed nonproportionality of hazards No
violations of the proportionality assumption were detected
for the main exposure Minor violations were observed in
covariates for certain models and a stratified Cox model
was fitted as follows overall analyses of current and past

Discussion
In this largescale populationbased Australian study
death rates in current smokers were around threefold
those of people who had never smoked in both men
and women On average smokers died around  years
earlier than nonsmokers over the ages examined Mor
tality rates increased substantially with increasing inten
sity of smoking with rates approximately doubling in
those smoking around  cigarettes per day and four to
fivefold those of neversmokers in current smokers of
 or more cigarettes per day Cessation of smoking
conferred large mortality benefits compared with con
tinuing to smoke These findings were adjusted for a range
of potential confounding factors including socioeconomic
status alcohol intake and BMI

These findings are virtually identical to those on the
contemporary risks of smoking from the UK and US
where the RR of allcause mortality in current versus
neversmokers has been consistently reported at  to
  and similar to a recent report from Japan
 The finding of similar RRs among smokers across
successive birth cohorts in this study indicates that in
common with these countries it is likely that the full
mortality impacts of smoking are being realised among
smokers in Australia The evolution of increasing smoking
attributable mortality over time is well documented with
RRs of allcause mortality in current versus neversmokers
of around  to  in the s to  to  in the
s  corresponding to up to around onethird
and onehalf of the deaths in smokers being attribut
able to smoking respectively The findings from this
and contemporary estimates from the US and UK indi
cate that up to twothirds of deaths in smokers in the
st century in these settings are likely to have been
caused by smoking  The progressive increase in
RRs has been attributed to the earlier commencement
of smoking and greater intensity of smoking among
successive birth cohorts along with reductions in mor
tality among neversmokers  In keeping with
this the smokingrelated RRs in countries where wide
spread heavy and prolonged smoking from an early age
began more recently are somewhat lower than those
observed here 

The study provides the first largescale direct evidence
on the relationship of smoking to mortality in Australia
The population examined displays quantitatively many
of the characteristics of a mature epidemic of smoking
in the Western context namely a relatively low preva
lence of current smoking similar prevalence of current
smoking in men and women long durations and stable
intensities of smoking among current smokers young
and stable age at commencing smoking a high prevalence
of past smoking and stable RRs of smokingrelated
mortality in successive birth cohorts  Consistent RRs

among successive birth cohorts were observed although
the tar content in cigarettes in Australia has fallen over
the last four decades  The findings also demonstrate
the continuing harms of smoking despite highly success
ful tobacco control measures and the need for continuing
attention and control The introduction of plain pack
aging for cigarettes in Australia in  is an example of
the continuing efforts required

This study has the strength of being large and population
based with independent and virtually complete data on
the outcome of allcause mortality The study ascer
tained smoking status from questionnaire items that
are based on those used in the Million Women Study
allowing direct international comparison of results 
Repeat data collection on smoking status allowed cor
rection for regression dilution such that the findings
relating to smoking intensity are likely to reflect long
term habits In keeping with the continuing decline in
smoking prevalence in Australia the data indicate that
a substantial minority of current smokers at baseline
ceased smoking during the followup period This sug
gests that the estimated hazard ratios for mortality
among current smokers at baseline are likely to be con
servative Although we do not have direct data on use
of smokeless tobacco products among participants im
portation and supply of these products has been illegal
in Australia since  and use has been negligible since
then 

The study provides evidence on the effects of heavy
and prolonged smoking in a setting where the preva
lence of smoking is now low Around  of individuals
aged  and over in NSW were estimated to be current
smokers at the time when the  and Up Study com
menced  and following exclusions current smokers
made up around  of the cohort It should be noted
that although the  and Up Study is like the vast ma
jority of cohort studies not strictly representative of the
general population the results presented here are based
on internal comparisons within the cohort and are likely
to be reliable  Moreover as the British Doctors Study
illustrates cohort studies do not need to be representative
to produce effect estimates that are generalizable Follow
up time was relatively short which has the advantage of
meaning that smoking status measured at baseline is likely
to broadly represent smoking status during the followup
period NSW is the most populous state in Australia
comprising around onethird of the total population
Smoking prevalence and causespecific death rates for
major causes of death in NSW are similar to those ob
served nationally 

To ensure that the study focussed on the likely causal
effect of smoking on mortality participants who had had
cancer or cardiovascular disease at baseline were exclu
ded Although it was not possible to exclude individuals
with chronic respiratory disease sensitivity analyses in
dicated that the results did not change materially when

Banks et al BMC Medicine    

Page  of 

individuals with a previous hospital admission including
a diagnosis of respiratory illness were excluded Because
of the tendency for smokers particularly older smokers
to quit due to illhealth it was not possible to reliably
estimate the mortality risks in those ceasing smoking at
older ages ie  years or older although they repre
sented the minority of past smokers It should be noted
that the findings here are contingent on surviving to age
 however few deaths attributable to smoking are likely
to have occurred below this age

The evidence presented here relates to death from any
cause Data on cause of death were not available at the
time this study was conducted International evidence
shows that the vast majority of excess deaths in smokers
are caused by smoking and are due to conditions such
as cardiovascular disease cancer and chronic lung dis
ease However it should be borne in mind that a minor
ity of deaths such as those related to suicide may be
increased in smokers but may not be wholly caused by
smoking Hence although we are not able to exclude the
relatively small number of deaths that are less likely to
be causally related to smoking the large majority of the
observed excess mortality in smokers observed here
would have been caused by smoking 

Conclusions
The national prevalence of smoking in Australia has
fallen rapidly and is now among the lowest in the world
with an estimated  of adults smoking daily A num
ber of countries are moving towards tobacco eradication
These data indicate that in a low prevalence setting the
risks of continuing to smoke and the benefits of cessation
remain high
