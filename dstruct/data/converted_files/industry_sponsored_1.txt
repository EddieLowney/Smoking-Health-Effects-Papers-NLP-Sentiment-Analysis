introduction Electronic cigarettes ecigarettes are designed to generate inhalable nicotine aerosol vapor When an eciga
rette user takes a puff the nicotine solution is heated and the vapor is taken into lungs Although no sidestream vapor is generated 
between puffs some of the mainstream vapor is exhaled by ecigarette user The aim of this study was to evaluate the secondhand 
exposure to nicotine and other tobaccorelated toxicants from ecigarettes

Materials and Methods We measured selected airborne markers of secondhand exposure nicotine aerosol particles PM 
carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds VOCs in an exposure chamber We generated ecigarette vapor from  vari
ous brands of ecigarette using a smoking machine and controlled exposure conditions We also compared secondhand exposure 
with ecigarette vapor and tobacco smoke generated by  dual users

results The study showed that ecigarettes are a source of secondhand exposure to nicotine but not to combustion toxicants 
The air concentrations of nicotine emitted by various brands of ecigarettes ranged from  to  gm The average con
centration of nicotine resulting from smoking tobacco cigarettes was  times higher than from ecigarettes    vs 
   gm respectively p  

Conclusions  Using  an  ecigarette  in  indoor  environments  may  involuntarily  expose  nonusers  to  nicotine  but  not  to  toxic 
tobaccospecific combustion products More research is needed to evaluate health consequences of secondhand exposure to nico
tine especially among vulnerable populations including children pregnant women and people with cardiovascular conditions

environmental tobacco smoke ETS is comprised primarily of 
sidestream smoke released from burning cigarettes during puff 
breaks and smoke exhaled by smokers after each puff While 
SHS  may  contain  the  same  toxic  substances  as  mainstream 
smoke  it  contains  higher  concentrations  of  many  toxic  and 
carcinogenic  compounds  than  mainstream  smoke  Although 
toxicants  released  from  burning  cigarettes  are  diluted  in  the

As  the  popularity  of  ecigarettes  increases  it  is  becoming 
important to further investigate patterns and levels of passive 
exposure to nicotine and other toxicants from ecigarettes The 
present study explores various factors that might contribute to 
emission of chemicals from ecigarettes It also aims to com
pare the passive exposure to nicotine particulates carbon mon

Materials and MethOds

Study Protocols

We  conducted  two  studies  to  assess  emissions  from  eciga
rettes The first study Study  was designed to evaluate major 
factors that might affect exposure patterns We generated vapor 
from  three  different  models  of  ecigarettes  and  released  the 
vapor into an experimental exposure chamber The aim of the 
second study Study  was to compare emissions from ecig
arettes and cigarette smoke generated by experienced users of 
both products Both studies are described in details below

Study With MachineGenerated Vapors Study 

Study    consisted  of    experiments  Table    Experiments 
 conducted in an exposure chamber each one lasting  hr 
During the first hour background levels of all analyzed mark
ers were taken During the second hour vapor from ecigarettes 
was generated using a smoking machine and released into the 
exposure chamber We measured hr average concentrations 



of nicotine aerosol particles PM CO and selected VOCs 
We also monitored changes in PM and CO levels over  hr

Electronic Cigarettes
We studied three different models of ecigarettes selected from 
the popular brands in Poland a Colinss Age with Camel High 
atomized  cartridge  cartomizer  Colins  Poland  EC  b 
Dekang  Pen with SGC Regular cartridge Ecigars Polska 
EC and c Mild M Pen with Marlboro cartridge Mild 
Poland EC Although all cartridges were labeled as contain
ing  mg of nicotine our previous study showed that they dif
fered in nicotine levels Colinss Camel contained  mg SGC 
Regular contained  mg and Mild Marlboro contained  mg 
of the drug Goniewicz Kuma et al  All products were 
purchased from online stores or shopping mall kiosks and ecig
arettes batteries were charged for  hr before the experiments

Exposure Chamber
A m laboratory room      m was equipped as 
an exposure chamber The chamber had plain acrylic painted 
walls and tiled floor with no windows carpets linings or cur
tains inside It was equipped with a regulated exhaust ventila
tion system and two fans for mixing the indoor air Inside the 
chamber  there  was  a  sampling  station  equipped  with  pumps 
and  monitors  a  smoking  machine  for  generating  ecigarette 
vapors see Generation of Vapors From ECigarettes section 
and  two  chairs  The  sampling  station  was  located    m  from 
a smoking machine and  cm above the level of ecigarettes

The air exchange rates were determined before each experi
ment  using  a  ventilation  marker  methane  released  into  the 
exposure  chamber  according  to  the  method  described  pre
viously  Czogala    Goniewicz    The  ventilation  rate 
during  the  study  varied  from    low  to    high  air 
changes per hour see also Supplementary Materials Before 
each experiment all surfaces inside the chamber were decon
taminated  by  wiping  with    aqueous  solution  of  ethanol 
and intensive ventilation Only one person who operated the 
smoking machine and sampling station was allowed inside the 
exposure chamber during Study 

Generation of Vapors From ECigarettes
In  order  to  generate  vapors  from  the  ecigarettes  a  smoking 
machine  was  placed  in  the  exposure  chamber  We  used  an 
automatic  singlechannel  pistonoperated  smoking  machine

Goniewicz Kuma et al  In all experiments the vapors 
from  ecigarettes  were  generated  using  the  following  puff
ing  conditions  puff  volume  of   ml  puff  duration  of    s 
and intervals between puffs of  s Two doses of vapor see 
Generation of Vapors From ECigarettes section were released 
into the exposure chamber with min interval

Vapors were generated from each of the three ecigarettes 
under two variants of ventilation intensive vs restricted and 
two variants of emission pattern high vs low  brands   
variants of ventilation   variants of emission Ventilation of 
the exposure chamber was controlled during each experiment 
and adjusted by operating the exhaust During the experiments 
with intensive ventilation exhaust from the exposure chamber 
was fully opened while it was partly closed during the experi
ments with restricted ventilation

secondhand exposure to vapors from ecigarettes

In order to modify exposure patterns vapors from  eciga
rettes  were  generated  using    or    puffs  for  low  and  high 
exposure  respectively  The  rationale  for  using  two  levels  of 
exposure low vs high was to examine various doses of nico
tine  released  with  secondhand  vapor  Although  studies  have 
shown  that  ecigarette  vapors  contain  significant  amounts  of 
nicotine there are some controversy as to whether this nicotine 
is effectively absorbed in the lungs Zhang Sumner  Chen 
 If there is little absorption vapor exhaled by ecigarette 
users might contain high levels of the drug We assumed that if 
an ecigarette user takes  puffs and no nicotine is absorbed 
then the entire amount of nicotine would be exhaled If ecig
arettes effectively deliver nicotine to the bloodstream exhaled 
vapors will contain only some of nicotine inhaled by the user 
By  releasing    puffs  we  simulated  the  scenario  in  which 
approximately half of the nicotine from  puffs is absorbed 
and the balance is exhaled

Analytical Procedures
Nicotine was measured using gas chromatography with  nitrogen
phosphorus detector following active sampling on XAD sorp
tion  tubes  SKC  Inc  according  to  the  National  Institute  of 
Occupational Safety and Health reference method  National 
Institute of Occupational Safety and Health  with a detec

continuously with a SidePak AM Personal Aerosol Monitor 
CO was also measured continuously with a QTrak Indoor Air 
Quality    monitor  both  instruments  from  TSI  Inc  The 
Sidepak was used with a calibration factor setting of  suit
able for secondhand smoke Jiang et al  Klepeis Ott  
Switzer  VOCs were analyzed using gas chromatography 
with  mass  spectrometry  following  active  sampling  on Anasorb 
CSC  sorption  tubes  SKC  Inc  according  to  the  Occupational 
Safety  and  Hazards  Agency  reference  method  Occupational

disCussiOn

Principal Findings

The key finding of this study is that ecigarettes emit significant 
amounts of nicotine but do not emit significant amounts of CO 
and VOCs We also found that the level of secondhand expo
sure  to  nicotine  depends  on  the  ecigarette  brand  However 
the emissions of nicotine from ecigarettes were significantly 
lower than those of tobacco cigarettes

Strengths and Limitations of the Study

To  our  knowledge  this  is  one  of  the  first  studies  to  measure 
the concentrations of nicotine PM CO and VOCs emitted 

by ecigarettes and to compare the emissions of electronic and 
conventional tobacco cigarettes in a conventionally ventilated 
fullsized  room  By  comparing  ecigarette  vapors  generated 
with  a  smoking  machine  to  those  generated  by  experienced 
ecigarette users in a controlled setting allowed us to control 
for potential factors that may affect exposure patterns

Results  from  experiments  with  human  subjects  who  used 
both electronic and tobacco cigarettes allowed us to compare 
the emissions and the potential exposures by the two products 
One of the most important aspects of our study is that the ecig
arette vapors and tobacco smoke were generated by longterm 
dual users of the products and we did not modified the way 
volunteers were typically using the products

Our  findings  are  supported  by  results  from  study  by 
McAuley et al  who examined the chemical composi
tion of freshly generated vapor collected in a small emission 
chamber  and  found  that  the  total  air  emission  concentrations 
for many pollutants from ecigarettes were very low Our study 
examined the potential effect of various ecigarette brands on 
patterns  of  exposure  whereas  McAuley  et  al    studied 
vapors generated from the same model of ecigarette with vary
ing  nicotine  solutions  and  found  that  the  chemical  composi
tion of the vapors from different solutions differed in levels of 
nicotine and other chemicals Our study showed that the level 
of exposure also differs between ecigarette brands These find
ings are also consisted with our previously reported data show
ing high variability in composition of freshly generated vapors 
among  the  products  Goniewicz  Kuma  et  al    These 
findings should be taken into careful consideration when expo
sure to ecigarette vapors is considered

The  study  has  several  limitations An  important  limitation 
of our study is that we measured a limited number of chemi
cals  that  might  be  contained  within  ecigarette  vapors  We 
reported  previously  that  ecigarette  vapors  contain  significant 
levels  of  carbonyls  including  toxic  and  carcinogenic  formal
dehyde  acetaldehyde  and  acrolein  Goniewicz  Knysak  
et al  These compounds were not measured in this study 
Studies by Schripp Markewitz Uhde and Salthammer  
and McAuley et al  found that there is a risk of exposure 
to carbonyls from ecigarettes although the levels of the com
pounds were lower than those in SHS We did not investigate 



other  significant  factors  affecting  exposure  to  ecigarette 
vapors for example room volume and number of ecigarettes 
used  simultaneously  in  a  single  room The  exposure  chamber 
input air was not filtered during the experiments and ventila
tion air exchange rates of exposure chamber were higher than 
residential rates Yamamoto Shendell Winer  Zhang  
Finally the study assessed concentrations of several markers in 
the air but not serum concentrations in people exposed to sec
ondhand vapors These airborne concentrations do not necessar
ily reflect the serum concentration and the impact on health of 
people exposed to these vapors

Unanswered Questions and Future Research

This  study  did  not  test  potential  health  effects  associated 
with  secondhand  exposure  to  vapors  from  ecigarettes  To 
date  there  are  few  studies  that  have  tested  the  acute  effects 
of brief exposure to secondhand ecigarette vapors One study 
by  Flouris  et  al    found  that  acute  passive  vaping  of 
ecigarettes did not influence complete blood count in human 
subjects Another  study  by  the  same  authors  found  that  con
trolled hr exposure to ecigarette vapors did not significantly 
affect  lung  function  in  human  subjects  Flouris  et  al   
We found no publications on the cardiovascular effects of pas
sive exposure to ecigarette vapors or on the health effects of 
secondhand  exposure  to  ecigarette  vapors  among  vulnerable 
population  including  children  pregnant  women  and  people 
with cardiovascular conditions

There is some discrepancy between our findings and results 
reported recently by Flouris et al  on secondhand exposure 
to nicotine Our data suggest that secondhand exposure to nicotine 
from ecigarettes is on average  times less than from tobacco 
smoke However Flouris et al  found that ecigarettes and 
tobacco  cigarette  generated  similar  effects  on  serum  cotinine 
levels  after  hr  passive  exposure      vs     ngml 
respectively p   Future research should look for correla
tion between indoor air levels of nicotine from ecigarettes and its 
uptake by passive smokers to explain this discrepancy

Future  research  should  also  study  exposure  patterns  over 
extended  periods  of  time  and  the  potential  health  effects  of 
longterm  exposure  to  secondhand  ecigarette  vapors  Data 
are  also  needed  from  the  field  studies  conducted  in  homes 
and public places where ecigarettes are in use Moreover this 
study only focused on nicotine and a limited number of chemi
cals  released  from  ecigarettes  Further  research  is  needed  to 
explore emission and exposure to other toxicants and carcino
gens  identified  in  ecigarettes  for  example  carbonyl  com
pounds Goniewicz Knysak et al 

It  remains  unclear  whether  concentration  of  PM  will 
be  a  suitable  and  reliable  airborne  marker  to  evaluate  emis
sion  and  exposure  to  secondhand  vapors  from  ecigarettes 
Although some studies suggest that ecigarette vapor and SHS 
have comparable aerosol particle size distribution and deposi
tion patterns we found that concentration of ecigarette aero
sol particles tends to decrease rapidly when diluted in the air 
Figure  shows that there is a significant particle mass signal 
from ecigarette vapor but that it dissipates much more rapidly 
than cigarette smoke This may be due to the evaporation of the 
aerosol in addition to deposition on the surfaces and removal 
by  ventilation  There  is  a  need  for  developing  an  accurate 
methodology to assess ecigarette vapor indoor concentrations 
Finally the vapor from ecigarettes might be easily deposited 

nicotine  tobacco research

on surfaces to form thirdhand ecigarette vapor and studies 
are needed to assess the deposition rate potential formation of 
toxic derivatives and human exposure

Implications for Policy Makers

The  study  showed  that  ecigarettes  might  involuntarily  expose 
nonsmokers and people who do not use ecigarettes to nicotine 
In the past secondhand exposure to nicotine has been primarily 
associated with exposure to ETS Ecigarettes have created the 
new scenario under which bystanders might be exposed to low 
levels  of  nicotine  but  not  to  the  other  toxins  found  in  tobacco 
smoke It remains unclear whether exposure to low levels of nic
otine indoors causes any harm to bystanders including children 
pregnant women and person with cardiovascular conditions

Besides  nicotine  ecigarette  vapor  contains  significant 
amounts of propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin Although 
both compounds are considered to be safe there is lack of data on 
health risk associated with prolonged exposure to their vapors 
Propylene glycol has been shown to cause upper airway irrita
tion Vardavas et al  Some volatile carbonyl compounds 
have been also identified in the vapor of ecigarettes Goniewicz 
Knysak et al  More research is needed about the health 
risk associated with exposure to toxic constituents of the vapors 
The physicochemical changes may also occur after vapors are 
released into ambient air It has been shown that such changes 
increase  toxicity  of  tobacco  smoke  two  to  fourfold  Schick 
  Glantz    These  data  are  needed  to  inform  regulators 
whether ecigarettes should be included under smokefree poli
cies to protect nonusers from inhaling the toxicants

Ecigarettes are promoted to circumvent smokefree policies 
Grana  Ling  Exempting ecigarettes from smokefree 
regulations besides creating secondhand exposure to nicotine 
might have additional implications for public health It remains 
unclear  whether  observation  of  smokers  using  ecigarettes 
especially by young people might reverse the denormalization 
of smoking behavior as a social norm Cigarette smokers might 
use ecigarettes as additional sources of nicotine in places with 
smoking bans Data are needed to determine whether dual use 
of the products ecigarettes in addition to tobacco cigarettes 
results in reinforcement of nicotine addiction
