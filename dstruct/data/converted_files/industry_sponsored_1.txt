introduction: Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are designed to generate inhalable nicotine aerosol (vapor). When an e-ciga-
rette user takes a puff, the nicotine solution is heated and the vapor is taken into lungs. Although no sidestream vapor is generated
between puffs, some of the mainstream vapor is exhaled by e-cigarette user. The aim of this study was to evaluate the secondhand
exposure to nicotine and other tobacco-related toxicants from e-cigarettes.
Materials and Methods: We measured selected airborne markers of secondhand exposure: nicotine, aerosol particles (PM ),
2.5
carbon monoxide, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in an exposure chamber. We generated e-cigarette vapor from 3 vari-
ous brands of e-cigarette using a smoking machine and controlled exposure conditions. We also compared secondhand exposure
with e-cigarette vapor and tobacco smoke generated by 5 dual users.
results: The study showed that e-cigarettes are a source of secondhand exposure to nicotine but not to combustion toxicants.
The air concentrations of nicotine emitted by various brands of e-cigarettes ranged from 0.82 to 6.23 µg/m3. The average con-
centration of nicotine resulting from smoking tobacco cigarettes was 10 times higher than from e-cigarettes (31.60 ± 6.91 vs.
3.32 ± 2.49 µg/m3, respectively; p = .0081).
Conclusions: Using an e-cigarette in indoor environments may involuntarily expose nonusers to nicotine but not to toxic
tobacco-specific combustion products. More research is needed to evaluate health consequences of secondhand exposure to nico-
tine, especially among vulnerable populations, including children, pregnant women, and people with cardiovascular conditions.
