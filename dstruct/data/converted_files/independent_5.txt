Mortality in relation to smoking  years observations on male
British doctors
Richard Doll Richard Peto Jillian Boreham Isabelle Sutherland

Abstract

Objective To compare the hazards of cigarette smoking in men
who formed their habits at different periods and the extent of
the reduction in risk when cigarette smoking is stopped at
different ages
Design Prospective study that has continued from  to

Setting United Kingdom
Participants   male British doctors Information about
their smoking habits was obtained in  and periodically
thereafter cause specific mortality was monitored for  years
Main outcome measures Overall mortality by smoking habit
considering separately men born in different periods
Results The excess mortality associated with smoking chiefly
involved vascular neoplastic and respiratory diseases that can
be caused by smoking Men born in  who smoked
only cigarettes and continued smoking died on average about
 years younger than lifelong nonsmokers Cessation at age
   or  years gained respectively about    or 
years of life expectancy The excess mortality associated with
cigarette smoking was less for men born in the th century
and was greatest for men born in the s The cigarette
smoker versus nonsmoker probabilities of dying in middle age
 were  v  a twofold death rate ratio for those
born in  but were  v  a threefold death rate
ratio for those born in the s At older ages the cigarette
smoker versus nonsmoker probabilities of surviving from age
 to  were  v  at the death rates of the s that is
among men born around the s but were  v  again
a threefold death rate ratio at the death rates of the s that
is among men born around the s
Conclusion A substantial progressive decrease in the mortality
rates among nonsmokers over the past half century due to
prevention and improved treatment of disease has been wholly
outweighed among cigarette smokers by a progressive increase
in the smoker v nonsmoker death rate ratio due to earlier and
more intensive use of cigarettes Among the men born around
 prolonged cigarette smoking from early adult life tripled
age specific mortality rates but cessation at age  halved the
hazard and cessation at age  avoided almost all of it

Introduction

During the th century much tobacco was smoked in pipes or
as cigars and little was smoked as cigarettes but during the first
the th century the consumption of
few decades of
manufactured cigarettes increased greatly This led eventually to
a rapid increase in male lung cancer particularly in the United

Kingdom where the disease became by the s a major cause
of death Throughout the first half of the th century the haz
ards of smoking had remained largely unsuspected Around the
middle of the century however several casecontrol studies of
lung cancer were published in Western Europe and North
America leading to the conclusion in  that smoking was
a cause and an important cause of the disease

 prospective study
This discovery stimulated much further research into the effects
of smoking not only on lung cancer but also on many other dis
eases including a UK prospective study of smoking and death
among British doctors that began in  and has now
continued for  years The decision that this study would be
conducted among doctors was taken partly because it was
thought that doctors might take the trouble to describe their own
smoking habits accurately but principally because their
subsequent mortality would be relatively easy to follow as they
had to keep their names on the medical register if they were to
continue to practise Moreover as most doctors would
themselves have access to good medical care the medical causes
of any deaths among them should be reasonably accurately
certified

The  study has now continued for much longer than
originally anticipated as the doctors did indeed prove easy to
follow and they provided further information about any changes
in their smoking habits along the way in    
and  A final questionnaire was sent out in 

By  the early findings had confirmed prospectively the
excess of lung cancer among smokers that had been seen in the
retrospective studies Findings on cause specific mortality in
relation to smoking were published after four periods of follow
up after four years  years  years  and  years The
early results from this study together with those from several
others
smoking was
associated with mortality from many different diseases Indeed
although smoking was a cause of the large majority of all UK
lung cancer deaths lung cancer accounted for less than half of
the excess mortality among smokers

that began soon after showed that

As recently as the s however the full eventual effects on
overall mortality of smoking substantial numbers of cigarettes
throughout adult life were still greatly underestimated as no
population that had done this had yet been followed to the end
of its life span The present report of the  year results chiefly
emphasises the effects on overall mortality subdivided by period
of birth of continuing to smoke cigarettes and of ceasing to do
so at various ages

Long term hazards
With the passage of time and the maturation among UK males
of the smoking epidemicthat is the arrival of a period in which
even in old age those who still smoked had in general been
smoking cigarettes regularly since youththe  year results
showed that the risks from really persistent cigarette smoking
were much larger than had previously been suspected and sug
gested that about half of all persistent cigarette smokers would
eventually be killed by their habit The  year results consolidate
these findings following even the participants who were born
after  well into old age

Britain was the first country in the world to experience a
large increase in male lung cancer from cigarette smoking
But even in Britain those born in the latter part of the th cen
tury had at a given age much lower lung cancer rates than the
worst affected generation of men who were born in Britain in the
first few decades of the next century Hence after presenting the
findings for mortality during  in the study as a whole
this report considers separately the findings among those
doctors born in the th century  and those born in
the th century  considering separately 
 and  Only among those born in the th
centurymany of whom were young when they started smoking
substantial numbers of cigarettescan we hope to assess the full
hazards of continuing to smoke cigarettes throughout adult life
and correspondingly the full long term benefits of stopping at
various ages

Previous reports of this and other studies     have
reviewed the associations of smoking with many specific causes
of death and considered the reasons for them leading to the
conclusion that in this study the substantial differences between
smokers and nonsmokers in overall mortality are due chiefly to
the causal effects of smoking This report therefore uses only 
major categories of cause of death some of which are quite
broad and several of its main analyses are of all cause mortality

Methods

Information about smoking habits was obtained in  and
periodically thereafter from two thirds of all male British
doctors and their cause specific mortality has been monitored
prospectively
the
information available from state records with data from personal
inquiries

from  to 

supplementing

Study population
The  questionnaire was sent to all doctors resident in the
United Kingdom whose addresses were known to the BMA At
that
time no relevant ethics committees existed Usable
responses were received from two thirds yielding information on
the smoking habits of   male doctors   
and  respectively born before  in  in 
 and in  Their age specific smoking habits have been
reported previously only  were lifelong nonsmokers

Efforts have been made to follow until  all those not
known to have died with the exception of  who were struck off
the medical register for unprofessional conduct  who
requested mostly in the fifth decade of the study no further
questionnaires and  who were known to be alive but living
abroad on  November  when we withdrew them Among
the remaining   the follow up of mortality is irrespective of
any other migration  complete with only  untraced
usually since the s  are known to have been alive on
 November  and   are known to have died before
then Those withdrawn before the end of the study or untraced

are included in the analyses of mortality until the time of
withdrawal or until contact was last made

Questionnaires
The original questionnaire in  asked only a few questions
about the individuals current smoking habits or for exsmokers
about the types and amounts of tobacco last smoked These were
elaborated in further questionnaires in    
and  to which the response rates after reminders varied
between  initially and  finally Accounts of the questions
asked have been reported previously as have the trends in
cigarette consumption Only the  questionnaire which
was
limited to those born in the th century sought
information about a wide range of characteristics height weight
blood pressure alcohol etc including medical history and asked
those who had stopped smoking whether they had done so
because they had already developed some serious respiratory or
vascular disease The  questionnaire sought only to check
that we had identified correctly the individuals we believed we
had traced

To help assess the effects of persistent cigarette smoking
those categorised as current cigarette smokers in reply to a
particular questionnaire had to have reported smoking
cigarettes and only cigarettes in that and any previous reply
This excludes all who had previously replied that they were using
any other type of
tobacco or no tobacco Likewise those
classified as former cigarette smokers were either exsmokers
in  whose last habit involved only cigarettes or current ciga
rette smokers defined as above who had stopped The terms
never smoker or nonsmoker mean lifelong nonsmoker
that is they exclude any respondent who had smoked on most
days for a year Those who despite reminders failed perhaps
because of illness to complete a particular questionnaire could
generally be traced for mortality and so continued to be analysed
according to their previously reported smoking habits

Causes of death
Causes were obtained for  of the deaths The underlying
cause on the death certificate was classified according to ICD
international classification of diseases seventh revision until
 then ICD except that lung cancer always excluded
pleural mesothelioma and pulmonary heart disease included
death from myocardial degeneration or heart failure with men
tion of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Until 
special inquiries of any mention of lung cancer were made but
perhaps because these men were themselves doctors this rarely
changed the certified cause

Statistical methods

Standardised mortality rates
The main analyses of mortality in relation to smoking seek to
determine whether among men in the same five year age group
 groups from  years to  years then   years
and the same time period either  five year or  one year
periods the death rate is related to the previously reported
smoking habits Apart from some directly standardised analyses
at ages 
indirect
standardisation for age group and time period to the person
years distribution of the whole population being considered
From these indirectly standardised death rates we calculated
relative risks

this generally involves as before

To assess the effects of smoking on mortality at ages  and
above for the cohort of men born in the th century and the
cohort born in the th century the relative risks comparing
various categories of smokers with never smokers are calculated

nonsmokers in both cohorts irrespective of any changes over
time in the death rates for nonsmokers

Survival curves
The proportions expected to survive from one age to another
are calculated by multiplying together the relevant five year age
specific survival probabilities These probabilities are calculated
as exp  R where exp is the exponential function and R is the
annual death rate deathsperson years in that age range This
exponential approximation is of adequate accuracy for each age
range up to and including  years

When survival curves of smokers and nonsmokers or of
smokers nonsmokers and exsmokers are to be compared to
assess the effects of tobacco they have to be standardised for cal
endar year To do this we calculated the death rate in each five
year age group by dividing the weighted sum of the numbers of
deaths in the relevant five year time periods by the similarly
weighted sum of the numbers of person years The weights are
proportional to the amount of statistical information contrib
uted by that time period to the smoker versus never smoker
comparison in that age group hence this ignores periods with
no deaths or without any smokers in the relevant age group

Results

Mortality by smoking habit and cause of death
Table  shows mortality by smoking habit
for  major
categories of cause of death and for all causes combined In
these and all other analyses current cigarette smokers are
restricted to those who in all their previous replies including the
first in  reported smoking only cigarettes Likewise former
cigarette smokers are restricted to those who before stopping
had reported in all their previous replies smoking only cigarettes
or who had stopped before  having last smoked only
cigarettes

As previously lung cancer and chronic obstructive lung dis
ease are closely related to continued cigarette smoking and to

the daily number of cigarettes smoked For each of the other
nine categories of cause of death there are more moderate but
again highly significant each P   positive relations with
the continuation of cigarette smoking and with the daily number

Effects on overall mortality
How far in this particular population such relations between
smoking and mortality reflect cause and effect has been
discussed previously  Midway through the study the results
from the  questionnaire confirmed the well known associa
tion between smoking and drinking but showed little or no
relation between smoking and either obesity or blood pressure
table  so these particular factors cannot help to account for
the excess vascular mortality among smokers The excess
mortality
and
poisoningamong smokers is unlikely to be due chiefly to
smoking although two men did die from fire because of smok
ing in bed but rather is likely to be due to other behavioural
factors with which smoking is associated such as the heavy con
sumption of alcohol or a willingness to take risks Such external
causes however account for less than  of the overall excess
mortality among cigarette smokers A quarter of the excess mor
tality among smokers is accounted for by lung cancer and
chronic obstructive lung disease and another quarter by ischae
mic heart disease most of the rest involves other neoplastic res
piratory or vascular diseases that could well be made more
probable among the survivors at a given age by smoking

Some of the  relations in table  have been increased by
confounding most notably with alcohol which can increase the
risk of developing cirrhosis of the liver and cancers of the mouth
pharynx larynx and oesophagus and with personality in the
case of accidents injury and poisoning Confounding however
can act in two directions as alcohol consumptionwhich is
higher among smokers than among nonsmokers table can

causalitythat is some reduction in the apparent risk of death
among current smokers because of a tendency for people to give
up smoking after they begin to be affected by some life threaten
ing condition table  whether or not their illness was caused by
smoking

When all  categories in table  are added together
however yielding overall mortality the combined effects of all
these noncausal factorsacting to increase or decrease the
apparent hazards among smokersare unlikely to have
influenced greatly the absolute difference between the overall
mortality rates of cigarette smokers and lifelong nonsmokers
This difference we conclude provides a reasonably quantitative
estimate of the extent to which at particular ages cigarette
smoking caused death in this population

Trends over time successive birth cohorts

th and th century births
In table  the relations between smoking and mortality at ages
 and over are shown separately for the cohort of men born late
in the th century and for the cohort born early in the th
century Restriction to ages  and over is necessary because the
study began in  so for those born in the th century it pro
vides little information on mortality at earlier ages

Cigarette smoking had become common among young men
in Britain by the end of the first world war  and
remained so for half a century reinforced by the issue of low
cost cigarettes to young military conscripts from  As a
result men who were born in the first second and particularly
the third decade of the th century and were still smoking ciga
rettes after the age of  had been smoking substantial numbers
throughout adult life This would not have been as much the case
for men who were born in the last decades of the th century
even if they too were smoking cigarettes after the age of 

The smoker versus nonsmoker relative risks in table  are
therefore much more adverse for smokers born in the th cen
tury than for those born earlier particularly for cigarette smok
ers For the cohort born in the th century the cigarette smoker
versus nonsmoker relative risk when they were over  years of
age was only  excess mortality  but for the cohort born
in the th century it was  excess mortality  For heavy
cigarette smokers  or more a day at their last reply the
smoker versus nonsmoker relative risk was  for the cohort
born in the th century and  for the cohort born in the
th century corresponding respectively to  and 
excess mortality among the smokers

The patterns of survival from age  in these two birth
cohorts among lifelong nonsmokers and among those who
smoked only cigarettes since  are shown in figure  which
gives the proportions of  year olds who would be expected to
be still alive at ages    and  The substantial improve
ment among nonsmokers is apparent as is the lack of substan
improvement among smokers corresponding to the

Fig  Survival from age  for continuing cigarette smokers and lifelong
nonsmokers among UK male doctors born  median  and
 median  with percentages alive at each decade of age

first decade of the century the difference between cigarette
smokers and nonsmokers in the probability of surviving from
age  to age  was only   v  corresponding to a
twofold death rate ratio but it was   v  a threefold
death rate ratio for those born in the third decade This
comparison again involves only a  year time difference

Trends over time successive study decades
If we compare mortality at ages  during the five separate
decades of the study  then the effects of a  year
time difference s v s can be studied as the ages of the
original respondents varied from only  to  Some 
men were already aged  at the start of the study and some
 of the younger respondents eventually survived to reach
their th birthday during the fifth decade of the study Thus in
each study decade we can observe the death rates of men in their
s and s and can calculate the probability that at the age spe
cific death rates prevailing in that particular decade a  year old
man would survive to age  table 

Over the five decades there is both a progressive reduction in
the mortality of elderly never smokers and counterbalancing
this a progressive maturing of the epidemic of the effects of
cigarette smoking on mortality in old age Table  shows a halv
ing of the standardised mortality rate at ages  among non
smokers and almost a tripling of their probability of surviving
from age  to age  which was  at the nonsmoker death
rates of the s and  at those of the s The mean
years of birth for those who died at ages  in the s and
the s were respectively  and 

These reductions in mortality of the lifelong nonsmokers
were presumably due both to prevention of and particularly to
improvements in the treatment of various diseases in elderly
people For example one of the present authors who is a
participant in the study acquired a pacemaker  years ago But

reductions in overall mortality at ages  that were occurring
among nonsmokers table  Among those born in about the

Fig  Survival from age  for continuing cigarette smokers and lifelong
nonsmokers among UK male doctors born  with percentages alive at
each decade of age

calculated from the logarithms of the survival probabilities in
figure  bottom graph Extrapolation of the trends in table 
suggests that these men will also have about a threefold smoker
versus nonsmoker death rate ratio in old age  This indi
cates that about two thirds of the persistent cigarette smokers
born in the s would eventually be killed by their habit

Over whole  year period
Figure  averages the findings in figure  for all men born in
 distinguishing between lifelong nonsmokers and
continuing cigarette smokers Among the latter the median age
when they began smoking was  and at the start of the study
their median age was  and their mean self reported cigarette
consumption was  a day The results suggest a shift of about
 years between the overall survival patterns of the continuing
cigarette smokers and the lifelong nonsmokers in this particular
generation That is not to say that all such smokers died about 
years earlier than they would otherwise have done some were

not killed by their habit but about half were thereby losing on
average more than  years of nonsmoker life expectancy
Indeed some of those killed by tobacco must have lost a few
decades of life

Mortality on stopping smoking
A high proportion of the doctors who had been smoking in
 stopped during the first decades of this study after it had
become generally accepted by the British medical profession
that cigarette smoking was a cause of most of the UK mortality
from lung cancer  We can therefore examine mortality for
some decades after stopping smoking table  As the benefits of
stopping cigarette smoking can be assessed directly only in a
population where the hazards of continuing to smoke cigarettes
are already substantial our main analyses of cessation are again
restricted to the men born in  Among them those
who stopped and those who continued smoking differed little in
obesity and blood pressure and differed only moderately in
mean alcohol consumption table 

But although many stopped when still relatively young and
healthy during the s and s some who stopped in later
middle age did so because they were already ill table  This
removal of some imminent deaths of smokers from the current
to the exsmoker category reduces the apparent mortality
among current smokers and may substantially inflate the appar
ent mortality of recent exsmokers For example mortality at
ages  among those who stopped smoking at ages  was
spuriously somewhat greater than mortality among continuing
smokers in that age group Although the death rates for
exsmokers in table  are given only for the age ranges after the
range in which smoking stopped they too may still be somewhat
affected by such reverse causality see above for definition

Mortality by age stopped smoking
Nevertheless table  shows a steady trend in mortality at older
ages  or  between lifelong nonsmokers excigarette
smokers who stopped at ages   or  and

continuing cigarette smokers Thus stopping earlier is associated
with greater benefit

Mortality for exsmokers is shown in figure  which bearing
in mind the possible relevance of reverse causality indicates that
even a  year old cigarette smoker could gain at least three years
of life expectancy by stopping fig  bottom graph In figure 
the mortality rates that would be seen at ages  among those
who stop at about age  had to be interpolated half way
between the smoker and nonsmoker rates as they could not be
assessed directly partly because of reverse causality and partly
because in this study there was often a delay of a few years before
the next questionnaire arrived and cessation could be reported
This however makes little difference to the long term survival
differences between continuing and excigarette smokers

Those who stopped at about age  gained about six years of
life expectancy those who stopped at about age  gained about
nine years and those who stopped before middle age gained
about  years and had a pattern of survival similar to that of
men who had never smoked fig  top graph

The mean cigarette consumption in  or when last
smoked if this was before  was similar to that in continuing
smokers for those who stopped at  and was only slightly
lower for those who stopped at  or  Thus the latter
had on average had substantial exposure to cigarette smoking
for about  years before giving up the habit yet they still
avoided most of the excess mortality that they would have
suffered if they had continued to smoke

Lung cancer mortality
Table  describes the age specific mortality just from lung cancer
among the same nonsmokers exsmokers and current cigarette
smokers comparing the observed numbers with the numbers
that would have been expected if they had had the age specific
lung cancer death rates of lifelong nonsmokers For statistical
stability these lung cancer death rates for nonsmokers are taken
from a much larger prospective study which began in  in
the United States see footnote to table  At these US rates
 lung cancer deaths at ages  would have been expected
among the lifelong nonsmokers in the present study and 
were observed which is a reasonably good match mortality ratio
 For the current cigarette smokers the corresponding
mortality ratio was   expected and  observed

There was a steady trend in this lung cancer mortality ratio
between lifelong nonsmokers exsmokers who had stopped at
 see table  footnote   or  and continu
ing smokers This trend confirms the findings from casecontrol
studies that there is substantial protection even for those who
stop at  and progressively greater protection for those who
stop earlier None the less those who had smoked until about 
years of age before they stopped had some excess risk of lung
cancer at older ages

By combining the penultimate columns of tables  and  we
calculated the annual lung cancer mortality rates per  con
tinuing cigarette smokers at ages  through to  to be
 that is    and  respectively At ages
 these rates are somewhat lower than in the general UK
population born around  which includes a mixture of non
smokers exsmokers and current smokers and at ages 
they are similar Hence the lung cancer death rates among male
cigarette smokers must have been even greater in the general
UK population than in this study

Discussion

Emergence of full hazards for persistent cigarette smokers
In many populations nowadays the consumption of substantial
numbers of cigarettes begins in early adult life and then contin
ues But the full eventual effects of this on mortality in middle
and old age can be studied directly only in a population such as
British males in which cigarette consumption by young adults
was already substantial when those who are now old were young
The generation of men born in Britain during the first few
the th century is probably the first major
decades of
population in the world of which this is true Daily cigarette con
sumption per UK adult one two four and six a day in

  and  respectivelymostly consumed by men
was three times as great in the second world war  as in
the first world war  Hence men born in the s
may well have had even more intense early exposure than those
born a decade or two earlier as in the United Kingdom
widespread military conscription of  year old men which
began again in  and continued for decades routinely
involved provision of low cost cigarettes to the conscripts This
established in many  year olds a persistent habit of smoking
substantial numbers of manufactured cigarettes which could
well cause the death of more than half of those who continued

Many however avoided the greater part of the risk by
stopping smoking although  of all UK males born around
 were smoking manufactured cigarettes in  at ages
 only  were still doing so in  at ages 
Hence as UK males born in  reached extreme old age
at the end of the th centuryor for those born in the s in
the early years of the st centurythey provide the first oppor
tunity to assess directly the hazards of persistent cigarette smok
ing and correspondingly in comparison with those who
continued the long term benefits of cessation

Trends in mortality from smoking and trends among
nonsmokers
The experience of the   men in this study who were born
in  shows persistent cigarette smoking to be more
hazardous than had appeared in previous analyses of this or any
other study figs  and  and shows correspondingly greater
long term benefits from cessation fig  Those who continued
to smoke cigarettes lost on average about  years of life
compared with nonsmokers while those who stopped at around
age    or  gained respectively about    or  years
life expectancy compared with those who continued
of
Moreover among those born in  the absolute
difference between cigarette smokers and nonsmokers in the
probability of death in middle age increased from   v
 a twofold death rate ratio for those born in the first decade
of the century to   v  a threefold death rate ratio
for those born in the s fig 

In old age table  the difference between cigarette smokers
and nonsmokers in the probability of a  year old surviving to
 increased from only   v  at the death rates seen
during the first decade of the study among men born on aver
age around  to   v  at the death rates seen
during the fifth decade of the study among men born on aver
age around  indicating that the corresponding difference
will be still greater for those born in the s If so then about
two thirds of the persistent cigarette smokers among them would
be killed by their habit Both in middle and in old age the

increasing difference between the mortality of cigarette smokers
and nonsmokers arises because the large progressive decrease
in the mortality of nonsmokers in recent decades has for the
the
counterbalanced by
cigarette smokers been wholly
increasing death rate ratio of smokers versus nonsmokers

Applicability of findings
Our  report of the  year findings concluded that Results
from the first  years of this study and of other studies at that
time the s substantially underestimated the hazards of
long term use of tobacco It now in the s seems that about
half of all regular cigarette smokers will eventually be killed by
their habit Ten years later the  year findings show that for the
continuing cigarette smokers in this study who were born in the
first second and third decades of the th century the eventual
risks vary from about one half to about two thirds fig 
although the mortality rates among them from lung cancer were
if anything somewhat lower than among their contemporaries
in the general UK population who smoked

It is a new finding that the risk of being killed by tobacco can
be as great as two thirds but this applies directly only to the haz
ards suffered by this particular group of professional British men
during the past half century If these results are to be used indi
rectly to help predict the risks that male female rich poor Brit
ish and nonBritish populations of persistent cigarette smokers
are likely to face over the next half century then it may be more
appropriate to retain the previous semiquantitative conclusion
that smoking kills about one half For although we have found
a population in which persistent cigarette smoking killed some
what more than half fig  there may be other circumstances in
which it kills somewhat less than half

Changes in cigarette manufacture might somewhat limit the
eventual hazards as might favourable changes in the prevention
or treatment of neoplastic respiratory or particularly vascular
disease But unless such changes produce much bigger propor
tional reductions in mortality among smokers than among non
smokers they will not make the age specific smoker versus non
smoker death rate ratios much less than  so the statement that
about half are killed by their habit will not be an exaggeration
Moreover the death rate ratios in table  which underlie figure
 are actually somewhat greater than  and the tendency in
some populations for intense cigarette smoking to be established
before the median age of  that was seen in this study can only
exacerbate the eventual risks
statement

in many very different
populations the future risk of death from persistent cigarette
smoking will still be about one half is therefore a reasonable one
and the results thus far in a widening range of studies in other
developed  and developing country populations such as

What is already known on this topic

About half of all persistent cigarette smokers are killed by
their habita quarter while still in middle age  years

After a large increase in cigarette smoking by young people
the full effects on national mortality rates can take more
than  years to mature

British men born in the first few decades of the th
century could be the first population in the world in which
the full long term hazards of cigarette smoking and the
corresponding benefits of stopping can be assessed directly

What this study adds

Among the particular generation of men born around
 cigarette smoking tripled the age specific mortality
rates

Among British men born  cigarette smoking
approximately doubled the age specific mortality rates in
both middle and old age

Longevity has been improving rapidly for nonsmokers but
not for men who continued smoking cigarettes

Cessation at age  halved the hazard cessation at 
avoided almost all of it

On average cigarette smokers die about  years younger
than nonsmokers

Stopping at age    or  gains respectively about 
  or  years of life expectancy

China and India  seem consistent with it as long as the
prolonged delay between cause and full effect is properly appre
ciated If so then on current worldwide smoking patterns
whereby about  of young adults become smokers there will
be about one billion tobacco deaths in this century unless there
is widespread cessation For with low tar cigarettes still
involving substantial hazards the quantitative conclusion from
this study that seems most likely to be robust is that even among
middle aged smokers cessation is effective and cessation at ear
lier ages is even more so
