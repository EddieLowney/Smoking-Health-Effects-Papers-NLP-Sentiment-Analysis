Abstract

Cigarette smoke is associated to severe chronic diseases The most harmful

components of cigarette smoke derive from the combustion process which are

significantly reduced in the electronic cigarette aerosol thus providing a valid option

in harm reduction strategies To develop safer products it is therefore necessary to

screen electronic cigarette liquids eliquids to meet high safety standards defined by

government regulations The aim of the present study was to evaluate the presence

of metal and plasticderived contaminants in four different commercial eliquids with

high concentration of nicotine and their cytotoxic effect in normal human bronchial

epithelial cells by a number of in vitro assays in comparison with the RF reference

cigarette using an airliquid interface ALI exposure system Moreover we evaluated

the effect of aerosol exposure on oxidative stress by measuring the production of

reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial potential Our

results showed no

contaminants in all eliquids and a significantly reduced cytotoxic effect of eliquid

aerosol compared to cigarette smoke as well as a maintained mitochondria integrity

Moreover no production of reactive oxygen species was detected with ecigarette

aerosol In conclusion these results support the reduced toxicity potential of ecigs

compared to tobacco cigarettes in an in vitro model resembling real

Cigarette smoke is associated to a number of diseases most of which

impact of tobacco smoke and of alternative tobacco products
including electronic cigarettes Since there is not a specific
indication or protocol for toxicity evaluation of ecig on human

bronchial epithelial cells we used a number of in vitro cytotoxicity

assays to screen four different eliquids with a high concentration of

Moreover the United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA

has recommended a Secondary Maximum Contaminant Level SMCL
of  mgL for aluminum in drinking water In tested eliquids
we found concentrations of  mgL for Al therefore

during the vaporization by ecig possibly due to the pyrolysis effect
