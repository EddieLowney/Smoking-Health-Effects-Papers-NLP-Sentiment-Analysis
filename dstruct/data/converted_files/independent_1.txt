Abstract

Introduction Electronic cigarettes ecigarettes are promoted as a less risky alternative to 
conventional cigarettes and have grown in popularity Experimental and clinical evidence suggests 
that they could increase the risk of myocardial infarction

Methods The National Health Interview Surveys of  n and  n were 
used to examine the crosssectional association between ecigarette use never former some days 
daily and cigarette smoking same categories and myocardial infarction in a single logistic 
regression model that also included demographics age gender BMI and health characteristics 
hypertension diabetes and hypercholesterolemia using logistic regression Data were collected 
in  and  and analyzed in  and 

Results Daily ecigarette use was independently associated with increased odds of having had a 
myocardial infarction OR  CI  p as was daily conventional cigarette 
smoking OR  CI  p Former and some day ecigarette use were not 
significantly associated with having had a myocardial infarction p and p whereas 
former OR p and some day cigarette smoking OR p were Odds of a 
myocardial infarction were also increased with history of hypertension OR p high 
cholesterol OR p and diabetes OR p and age OR per  
years p Women OR p had lower odds of myocardial infarction

Conclusions Daily ecigarette use adjusted for smoking conventional cigarettes as well as 
other risk factors is associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction

INTRODUCTION

Electronic cigarettes ecigarettes which deliver an aerosol of usually nicotine and other 
flavors by heating a liquid are often promoted as a safer alternative to conventional 
cigarettes which generate the nicotine aerosol by burning tobacco Both ecigarettes and

conventional cigarettes deliver ultrafine particles that are one to two orders of magnitude 
smaller than a human hair which in smoke and air pollution increase risk of 
cardiovascular disease and acute myocardial infarction MI with a nonlinear dose response 
curve MI risk drops when people stop smoking conventional cigarettes or stop being 
exposed to secondhand smoke Ecigarette and traditional cigarette smoking in healthy 
smokers with no known cardiovascular disease exhibit similar inhibition of endothelial 
function as measured by flowmediated dilation of arteries shift in cardiac autonomic 
balance toward sympathetic predominance and increased oxi dative stress which 
are associated with increased cardiac risk There is also increased oxidative stress in 
both ecigarette users and conventional cigarette smokers Laboratory studies done with e
cigarette extracts found that ecigarette use increases the release of inflammatory mediators 
from keratinocyte alveolar epithelial cell lines and neutrophils Ecigarette aerosol also 
induces platelet activation aggregation and adhesion In mice chronic whole body 
exposure to ecigarette aerosol accelerates aortic stiffness significantly impairs aortic 
endothelial function and may lead to impaired cardiac function These observations led 
the authors to hypothesize that ecigarette use would be associated with increased risk of 
acute MI

METHODS

Study Population

The National Health Interview Survey NHIS a survey of people aged  years is 
conducted by the US Census Bureau using in person interviews in a random sampling of 
US households Data from the  and  NHIS were used

Measures

Subjects who answered yes to the question Have you EVER been told by a doctor or other 
health professional that you had a heart attack also called myocardial infarction were 
classified as having had an MI

The full model includes current and former ecigarette use and cigarette use as separate 
variables in the same model together with demographic sex age BMI raceethnicity and 
clinical covariates for MI hypertension diabetes mellitus high cholesterol Dual users 
were indicated by the concurrent values of the ecigarette and cigarette variables rather than 
as a separate category

Subjects who answered no to Have you ever used an ecigarette even one time were 
classified as never users Subjects who answered yes were then asked Do you now use e
cigarettes every day some days or not at all Subjects who responded not at all were 
classified as former users and those who selected some days and every day were classified as 
some day users and daily users respectively

Subjects were classified as never smokers if they answered no to the question Have you 
smoked at least  cigarettes in your ENTIRE LIFE Subjects were classified as former 
smokers if they had smoked  cigarettes but answered not at all to Do you NOW smoke

cigarettes every day some days or not at all The remaining subjects were classified as some 
day smokers and daily smokers

Demographic characteristics in the analysis were sex and age at time of survey These data 
were obtained by asking the subjects Are you Male or Female And How old are you BMI 
was obtained and calculated based on each subjects height How tall are you without 
shoes and weight How much do you weigh without shoes Raceethnicity was classified 
as Hispanic nonHispanic white nonHispanic black nonHispanic Asian or other

This study assessed the diagnosis of hypertension high cholesterol and diabetes mellitus 
from those who answered yes to the questions Have you EVER been told by a doctor or 
other health professional that you had  hypertension also called high blood pressure 
high cholesterol or  diabetes or sugar diabetes respectively For diabetes people who 
responded no or borderline or prediabetes were coded as no People who refused were not 
asked or did not know were coded as missing

Statistical Analysis

Descriptive statistics means and SDs for continuous variables and frequency tables for 
categorical variables were computed and oneway ANOVA and chisquare were used to test 
for differences between never former and current ecigarette users

Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of having had an MI as a function of e
cigarette use cigarette smoking and the other covariates listed above in a single logistic 
regression This approach concurrently estimates both the effects of ecigarette and cigarette 
use at the same time while controlling for the other product use The reference condition for 
both ecigarette use and cigarette smoking is people who never used ecigarettes or 
cigarettes

There was no evidence of multicollinearity in the fully adjusted models all variance 
inflation factors  Interaction between cigarette and ecigarette use was tested using a 
variable that was set to  for respondents who currently used both cigarettes and ecigarettes 
 otherwise this interaction term was not significant p so the final logistic 
regression model does not include an interaction The lack of a significant interaction 
suggests that the effects of ecigarettes and conventional cigarettes on having had an MI are 
independent of each other

Subjects with missing data  were not included in the final analysis leaving an 
analytic sample size of  for the multivariable analysis

Analyses were performed using Stata version  accounting for the complex survey 
design of NHIS and following NHIS procedures for combining the  and  data sets
 Data were collected in  and  and analyzed in  and 

RESULTS

Demographic and health characteristics for subjects who used ecigarettes are shown in 
Table  Appendix Tables  and  available online contain the results for  and

separately The analysis of combined data showed that  of current some days or 
daily ecigarette users were former smokers and  of current ecigarette users were 
current some days or daily cigarette smokers

Current ecigarette users were less likely to be daily users  or  than were 
current cigarette smokers  or  p

Both unadjusted and adjusted models of the combined data showed that odds of having had 
an MI is about  for daily ecigarette users compared with subjects who had never used e
cigarettes suggesting that the effect was independent of cigarette smoking status never 
former some days daily demographic factors and other health conditions Table  and 
Figure  Appendix Tables  and  available online contain the analyses of the  and 
 data separately Neither former nor some day ecigarette use are associated with 
increased risk of MI p and p

By comparison in the adjusted model being a daily cigarette smoker is associated with odds 
of having had an MI of  controlling for ecigarette use Being a some day or former 
cigarette smoker is also associated with increased odds of having had an MI

DISCUSSION

This is the first study to examine the relationship between ecigarette use and MI The fact 
that the use of ecigarettes and conventional cigarettes are both included in the same logistic 
regression means that they both independently contribute to the risk of having had an MI 
after adjusting for other risk factors including the use of the other product All the ORs in 
Table  estimate the independent risks compared with people who have never used e
cigarettes or cigarettes

Because the different products are independently associated with risk of having had an MI it 
is possible to use the results in Table  to estimate other behaviors including dual use and 
switching from cigarettes to ecigarettes For example the total odds of having had an MI 
among a former cigarette smoker who currently uses ecigarettes daily is odds of MI among 
former smokers  odds of MI among daily ecigarette user       compared 
with a never smoker who has never used ecigarettes Thus odds of having had a heart 
attack for an individual who switched from daily smoking to daily ecigarette use would 
change by a factor of

odds of MI among former smoker  odds of MI among daily e  cigarette user

 odds of MI among daily smoker           

By contrast the total odds of having had an MI among a current daily dual user who both 
smokes cigarettes daily and also uses ecigarettes daily is odds of MI among daily smoker 
 odds of MI among daily ecigarette user       compared with a never 
smoker who has never used ecigarettes In other words dual use of ecigarettes and 
conventional cigarettes appears to be more dangerous than using either product alone 
Finally the total odds of having had a heart attack for an individual who switched from daily 
smoking to daily ecigarette use compared with quitting smoking cold turkey would be

These results are consistent with biological studies which showed that ecigarette use is 
associated with endothelial dysfunction oxidative stress inflammation platelet activation 
and activation of the sympathetic nervous system These results suggest that e
cigarettes represent an independent risk factor for MI on top of the effects of smoking

The point estimate of the odds of MI associated with daily ecigarette use   
CI  is lower than current cigarette smoking   CI  in the 
adjusted models Table  The difference may also reflect differences in the unknown 
intensity of use but this may not be a major factor because smoking even a single cigarette a 
day has about half the risk of being a packaday smoker This difference may be because 
ecigarettes are not as dangerous as cigarettes statistical uncertainty or the fact that some e
cigarette users likely had MIs before ecigarettes became available which will bias the 
estimated OR to the null

In contrast to the lasting effect associated with being a former cigarette smoker there was 
not a significant increase in MI risk for former or some day ecigarette users Table  It 
may be that the risks of ecigarette use dissipate rapidly when someone stops using them 
that some people briefly experiment with ecigarettes and stop using them before any lasting 
damage is done or that ecigarettes have not been available long enough to cause permanent 
damage to the cardiovascular system

The associations between the traditional risk factors and MI observed in this study are 
comparable to prior reports which increases the confidence one can have in the findings on 
the association between ecigarette use and MI The increased odds of an MI associated with 
being a current OR  CI  combining daily and nondaily current 
smokers and former smoker OR  CI  in this analysis are similar to 
the results ORs and CIs from two earlier casecontrol studies   CI  and 
  CI  in the Rosenthal et al study and   CI and  
 CI  in the INTERHEART study conducted in  countries

The odds associated with other risk factors including hypercholesterolemia diabetes 
mellitus and hypertension on acute MI found in this study are also consistent with previous 
studies The United Kingdom prospective diabetes study showed that the estimated hazard 
ratio for coronary artery disease comparing the upper third relative to the lower third was 
  CI  for hemoglobin Ac which is a diagnostic marker for diabetes 
mellitus Almdal and colleagues studied the effect of type  diabetes mellitus on 
ischemic heart disease in a populationbased study with  years of followup and found that 
diabetes mellitus increases the risk of acute MI or stroke by  to fold in men and  
tofold in women In European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition 
Potsdam study the odds of MI increases by fold  CI  for diabetes 
mellitus and fold  CI  for hypertension Glazer et al reported that

risk of MI is high OR  CI  in individuals with a high level of total 
cholesterol

Limitations

The NHIS is a crosssectional study so it only permits identifying associations rather than 
causal relationships NHIS relies on selfreport so there is also the possibility of recall bias 
However NHIS is conducted in person and the question Have you EVER been told by a 
doctor or other health professional that you had a heart attack also called myocardial 
infarction specifically asks if the respondent was told by a doctor or other health 
professional that he or she had a heart attack which presumably reflects clinical validation 
of the diagnosis by his or her doctor In addition studies in Finland and Minnesota found 
 and  agreement between selfreported MI and medical records

It is not known when the MIs occurred relative to ecigarette use and it is likely that some of 
the heart attacks subjects reported occurred before ecigarettes became available in the US 
around  This situation will bias the OR estimates toward the null meaning that the 
study results likely underestimate the true risks associated with ecigarette use

One could argue that ecigarette usage may simply be indicative of a smoking cessation 
strategy in traditional cigarette smokers who had their MI while they were smoking 
traditional cigarettes The logistic regression explicitly allows for the eventuality that some 
people switched from cigarettes to ecigarettes before the data were collected because it 
included both smoking behavior and ecigarette use in the same model including status as a 
former smoker If someone switched from cigarettes to ecigarettes in order to quit smoking 
after an MI and the increased risk was due to being a former smoker that risk would be 
captured in the former smoker variable rather than appearing as an artifact in one of the e
cigarette variables Moreover for this situation to induce a spurious association between e
cigarette use and having had an MI people who had MIs and subsequently quit smoking 
would have to have done so preferentially with ecigarettes as a smoking cessation device 
more than smokers who had not had an MI No data to support this assumption could be 
identified

Although the definition for smoker is well established there is not yet a consensus on how to 
define established ecigarette users and there is no information on amount time or duration 
of ecigarette use As a result the ecigarette users likely include experimenters who only 
used an ecigarette a few times as well as regular users Former smokers and former e
cigarette users are defined differently with former smokers having had to have smoked  
or more cigarettes in the past and former ecigarettes users only having had to have used one 
ecigarette in the past This difference in how users are defined will likely bias estimates of 
the risks associated with ecigarette use toward the null

Other limitations include the fact that there is no information on the size of the MI As with 
any study there is always the possibility of unknown confounding from variables not 
included in the analysis such as family history of MI physical activity level and statin use 
The fact that the results from smoking and the other risk factors are consistent with previous

longitudinal studies as well as experimental studies on the acute cardiovascular effects of e
cigarette use increases the confidence one can have in conclusions regarding ecigarettes

CONCLUSIONS

Daily ecigarette use is associated with increased odds of MI independent of and in addition 
to the risks associated with smoking and other risk factors Dual use of ecigarettes and 
conventional cigarettesthe most common use pattern among ecigarette usersis more 
dangerous than using either product alone From these findings recreational use of e
cigarettes or use of ecigarettes for smoking cessation should not be recommended
