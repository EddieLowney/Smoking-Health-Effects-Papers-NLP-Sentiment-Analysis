Environmental tobacco smoke and tobacco related
mortality in a prospective study of Californians 
James E Enstrom Geoffrey C Kabat

Abstract

Objective To measure the relation between
environmental tobacco smoke as estimated by
smoking in spouses and long term mortality from
tobacco related disease
Design Prospective cohort study covering  years
Setting Adult population of California United States
Participants   adults enrolled in late  in
the American Cancer Society cancer prevention study
CPS I who were followed until  Particular focus
is on the   never smokers who had a spouse in
the study with known smoking habits
Main outcome measures Relative risks and 
confidence intervals for deaths from coronary heart
disease lung cancer and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease related to smoking in spouses and
active cigarette smoking
Results For participants followed from  until 
the age adjusted relative risk  confidence interval
for never smokers married to ever smokers compared
with never smokers married to never smokers was 
 to  for coronary heart disease   to
 for lung cancer and   to  for
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease among 
men and   to    to  and
  to  respectively among   women
No significant associations were found for current or
former exposure to environmental tobacco smoke
before or after adjusting for seven confounders and
before or after excluding participants with preexisting
disease No significant associations were found during
the shorter follow up periods of  
 and 
Conclusions The results do not support a causal
relation between environmental tobacco smoke and
tobacco related mortality although they do not rule
out a small effect The association between exposure
to environmental tobacco smoke and coronary heart
disease and lung cancer may be considerably weaker
than generally believed

Introduction

Several major reviews have determined that exposure to
environmental tobacco smoke increases the relative risk
of coronary heart disease based primarily on compar
ing never smokers married to smokers with never smok
ers married to never smokers The American Heart

Association the California Environmental Protection
Agency and the US surgeon general have concluded
that the increase in coronary heart disease risk due to
environmental
tobacco smoke is  relative risk
 Metaanalyses of epidemiological studies have
reported summary relative risks  confidence inter
vals of   to    to  and 
 to  for coronary heart disease and  
to  and   to  for lung cancer  similar
to the  found by the California Environmental Pro
tection Agency and the US surgeon general  The US
Environmental Protection Agency has classified envi
ronmental tobacco smoke as a known human carcino
gen Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease primarily
asthma bronchitis and emphysema has been associated
with exposure to environmental tobacco smoke but the
evidence for increased mortality is sparse 

self

so strong that

Although these reviews come to similar conclu
sions the association between environmental tobacco
smoke and tobacco related diseases is still controversial
owing to several
limitations in the epidemiological
studies Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke
is difficult to measure quantitatively and therefore has
been approximated by
reported estimates
primarily smoking history in spouses Confounding by
the
active cigarette smoking is
association with environmental tobacco smoke can
only be evaluated among never smokers The relation
between tobacco related diseases and environmental
tobacco smoke may be influenced by misclassification
of some smokers as never smokers misclassification of
exposure status to environmental tobacco smoke and
several potential confounders It is also unclear how
the reported increased risk of coronary heart disease
due to environmental tobacco smoke could be so close
to the increased risk due to active smoking  and
 respectively since environmental tobacco smoke
is much more dilute than actively inhaled smoke

Most epidemiological studies have found that envi
ronmental tobacco smoke has a positive but not statis
tically significant relation to coronary heart disease
and lung cancer Metaanalyses have combined these
inconclusive results to produce statistically significant
summary relative risks However there are problems
inherent in using metaanalysis to establish a causal
relation The epidemiological data are subject to the
limitations described above They have not been
collected in a standardised way and some relative risks

Follow up
Long term follow up was undertaken at the University
of California at Los Angeles on all  
participants from California This is described in detail
elsewhere and summarised in table  The partici
pants were matched several times with the California
death file and the social security death index on the
basis of their name and other identifying variables 
Overall   deaths were identified up to 
December  and the underlying cause was
obtained from the California death file and death cer
tificates for    of these deaths

Participants were also matched with information
given on their California drivers licence based prima
rily on name date of birth and height We obtained the
address given during the s for   participants
who were not known as dead as of  and these par
ticipants were assumed to be alive in  Of the
remaining participants in the studys master database
 were withdrawn from further follow up as of Sep
tember  because their complete name was not
retained and  were lost to follow up as of 
because their vital status was unknown

To assess the current status of surviving cohort
members
in mid we sent out a two page
questionnaire on smoking and lifestyle to those
participants with an address for  or later on their
drivers licence Overall  of  men 
and  of   women  completed the
questionnaire Responses to name date of birth and

The follow up period was from time of entry to the
study  January to  March  until death
withdrawal date last known alive or end of follow up
 December  The participants were aged

of observation and the  deaths during  The
underlying cause of each death was assigned according
to the international classification of diseases seventh

defined as  ICD during   ICD

Smoking history of the spouse as assessed in  was
strongly related to exposure to environmental tobacco
smoke as of  for both men and women table 

smoking in spouses This bias produces a measured
relative risk that is greater than the true relative risk
but by a negligible amount for this level of bias 

Misclassification of exposure and smoking status
Although there was substantial misclassification of
environmental tobacco smoke exposure status from
 to  it was less for those never smokers aged
 or over at enrolment see table  never smokers
defined in  data not shown and never smokers
defined in  see table  Misclassification of expo
sure status produces a measured relative risk that is
closer to  than the true relative risk  The extent of
misclassification from  to  could not obscure
a true association with a relative risk of about  if it
exists among women but it could largely obscure this
association among men However this level of misclas
sification which is based on the changes that occurred
over  years among the younger than average 
respondents exaggerates the true level of misclassifica
tion that occurred among the cohort as a whole
particularly during short follow up periods

Essentially all  never smokers remained never
smokers on the basis of smoking status reported in
  and  table  Of those who reported
a history of smoking in  most had smoked no
more than  cigarettes per day for a few years and
most had quit smoking before  This indicates
only a small degree of misclassification of smoking sta
tus Some bias exists in the misclassification of smoking
status among the  never smokers because the
percentage who smoked in the  and  surveys
was greatest among those with the highest levels of

Effect of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke
Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke was not
significantly associated with the death rate for coronary
heart disease
lung cancer or chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease in men or women tables  and 
This was true for all  never smokers and 
never smokers aged  or over at enrolment followed
during  and for  never smokers followed
during  The relative risks were slightly
reduced after adjustment
seven confounders
Results were essentially unchanged among the healthy
participants only data not shown The relative risks
were consistent with  for virtually every level of
exposure to environmental tobacco smoke current or
former Only the relative risks for chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease suggested an association An
environmental tobacco smoke index based on seven or
eight levels of smoking in a spouse yielded a relative
risk of about  for each level of change and no
suggestion of a doseresponse trend

for

In addition analyses for coronary heart disease
were performed for three short follow up periods with
presumably smaller misclassification errors All relative
risks for coronary heart disease were consistent with
 for the follow up periods of   and
 for never smokers defined as of  
and  table  In particular the relative risk for
current smoking in a spouse was not increased and

there were no trends based on the environmental
tobacco smoke index

As expected there was a strong positive dose
response relation between active cigarette smoking
and deaths from coronary heart disease lung cancer
and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease during
 table  These relative risks were
consistent with those for the full CPS I cohort until
  As it is generally considered that exposure to
environmental tobacco smoke is roughly equivalent to
smoking one cigarette per day we extrapolated the
relative risk due to exposure to environmental tobacco
smoke from the relative risks
smoking 
cigarettes per day These extrapolated relative risks
were about  for coronary heart disease and about
 for lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmo
nary disease Based on these findings exposure to
environmental
tobacco smoke could not plausibly
cause a  increase in risk of coronary heart disease
in this cohort although a  increase in risk of lung
cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
could not be ruled out

for

Discussion

On the basis of our findings from the long term follow
up of the California cohort of the cancer prevention
study CPS I the association between exposure to
environmental tobacco smoke and coronary heart dis

ease and lung cancer may be considerably weaker than
generally believed Although participants in CPS I are
not a representative sample of the US population
never smokers in this cohort had a total death rate that
was close to that of US white never smokers Further
more the relative risks were based on comparisons
within the cohort and should be valid Although the
participants total exposure to smoking in a spouse was
affected by the substantial extent of smoking cessation
since  this did not affect the relative compari
sons Also the relative risks during short follow up
periods with limited cessation were similar to the long
term risks

Strengths of study
CPS I has several important strengths long established
value as a prospective epidemiological study large size
extensive baseline data on smoking and potential con
founders extensive follow up data and excellent long
term follow up None of the other cohort studies on
environmental tobacco smoke has more strengths and
none has presented as many detailed results Consider
ing these strengths as a whole the CPS I cohort is one
of the most valuable samples for studying the relation
between environmental tobacco smoke and mortality
Concern has been expressed that smoking status of
the spouse as of  does not accurately reflect total
exposure to environmental tobacco smoke because
so much exposure to nonresidential
there was

Smoking in spouse defined by  questionnaire
Index of environmental tobacco smoke based on seven or eight levels of smoking in spouse
Smoking in spouse defined by  questionnaire for  and by  questionnaire for 

environmental tobacco smoke at that time The 
questionnaire showed that
the smoking status of
spouses was directly related to a history of total expo
sure to environmental tobacco smoke It also showed
that the extent of misclassification of exposure was not
sufficient
to obscure a true association between
environmental tobacco smoke and coronary heart dis
ease among women see tables  and 

Our methodology and results are fully described
because of concern that the earlier analysis of coronary
heart disease in CPS I  was flawed by author bias
owing to funding by the tobacco industry Our results
for coronary heart disease and lung cancer are consist
ent with those of most of the other individual studies
including the
on environmental
results for coronary heart disease and lung cancer in
the full CPS I  Moreover when our results are
included in a metaanalysis of all results for coronary
heart disease the summary relative risks for current
and ever exposure to environmental tobacco smoke
are reduced to about  indicating a weak relation

tobacco smoke

Widowhood was strongly correlated with smoking
status of spouses owing to the reduced survival of
smokers Since widowers have higher death rates than
married people  controlling for widowhood would
be expected to reduce the relative risks in this and
other studies of smoking in spouses The precise effect
of widowhood due to smoking in spouses still needs to
be determined but it may partially explain the positive
relative risks found in other cohorts

Conclusion
The results of the California CPS I cohort do not sup
port a causal relation between exposure to environ

What is already known on this topic

Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke is
generally believed to increase the risk of coronary
heart disease and lung cancer among never
smokers by about 

This increased risk based primarily on
metaanalysis is still controversial due to
methodological problems

What this study adds

In a large study of Californians followed for 
years environmental tobacco smoke was not
associated with coronary heart disease or lung
cancer mortality at any level of exposure

These findings suggest that the effects of
environmental tobacco smoke particularly for
coronary heart disease are considerably smaller
than generally believed

Active cigarette smoking was confirmed as a
strong dose related risk factor for coronary heart
disease lung cancer and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease

Values in parentheses are index level of active cigarette smoking

mental tobacco smoke and tobacco related mortality
although they do not rule out a small effect Given the
limitations of the underlying data in this and the other
studies of environmental tobacco smoke and the small
size of the risk it seems premature to conclude that
environmental
tobacco smoke causes death from
coronary heart disease and lung cancer

We thank Lawrence Garfinkel and Clark W Heath Jr former
vice presidents for epidemiology and statistics American
Cancer Society for facilitating the extended follow up of CPS I
and for making helpful comments and suggestions and Saman
Assefi and Parveen Sra for technical assistance
Contributors JEE conceived the study and obtained funding
conducted the extended follow up analysed the data and
drafted the manuscript he will act as guarantor for the paper
GCK contributed to the follow up questionnaire advised on the
data analysis and interpretation and contributed extensively to
the manuscript
Funding The American Cancer Society initiated CPS I in 
conducted follow up until  and has maintained the original
database Extended follow up until  was conducted at the
University of California at Los Angeles with initial support from
the TobaccoRelated Disease Research Program a University of
California research organisation funded by the Proposition 
cigarette surtax wwwucopedusrphometrdrp After continu
from the TobaccoRelated Disease Research
ing support
Program was denied follow up through  and data analysis
were conducted at University of California at Los Angeles with
support from the Center for Indoor Air Research a 

research organisation that received funding primarily from US
tobacco companies
Competing interests In recent years JEE has received funds
originating from the tobacco industry for his tobacco related
epidemiological research because it has been impossible for
him to obtain equivalent funds from other sources GCK never
received funds originating from the tobacco industry until last
year when he conducted an epidemiological review for a law
firm which has several tobacco companies as clients He has
served as a consultant to the University of California at Los
Angeles for this paper JEE and GCK have no other competing
interests They are both lifelong nonsmokers whose primary
interest is an accurate determination of the health effects of
tobacco
