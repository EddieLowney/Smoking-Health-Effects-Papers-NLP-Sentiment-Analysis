SUMMARY 
The relationship of environmental tobacco smoke to lung cancer risk in lifelong nonsmokers is commonly 
studied using marriage to a smoker as the index of exposure As smokers tend to marry smokers relative risk 
estimates will  be biased  if some current or former smokers are misclassified as lifelong nonsmokers This 
paper  shows how  various factors affect  the magnitude of  the bias  and  describes a method  for  obtaining 
misclassificationadjusted relative  risk  estimates Application  of  the method  to  US  and  Asian  data for 
women  suggests  misclassification  is  an  important  determinant  of  the  slight  excess  risk  observed  in 
nonsmokers married to smokers Reasons why our conclusions differ from those of  others are discussed as 
are other difficulties in  interpreting  the association between spousal smoking and lung cancer  risk 

  INTRODUCTION 

Error in the variables studied can bias the relationship of a risk factor to a disease In  x  tables 
random  misclassification  of  exposure  or  disease  biases  relative  risk  RR  estimate  towards 
unity  How  the  bias  relates  to  the  misclassification  rate  and  the  disease  and  exposure 
frequency has been decribed Additional information on accuracy of exposure data can be used 
to obtain unbiased  RR  estimates 

Random  misclassification  of  exposure  understates

misclassification of  confounding variables may  not How misclassification affects RR estimates 
adjusted for a single confounder with two levels has been 
errors in the  confounder  adjustment  has  little effect Even for  smaller      per  cent errors 
about half the confounding effect remains after adjustment Tzonou et aL note that Generally in 
the presence  of  strong risk  factors which have potentially  large confounding  effects and which 
may  have  been  imprecisely  measured  the  etiological  significance of  factors  observed  to  be 
relatively weakly associated with disease must  be treated  with caution 

With large    per cent 

true  associations  but 

Since  the possible association of  lung cancer with environmental  tobacco smoke ETS 
exposure has been extensively studied Since this association if it existed would be much weaker 
than that with active smoking and since it is hard to quantify precisely the many aspects of active 
smoking  correlated  with  risk  ETS  studies  usually  consider  only  lifelong  nonsmokers  The 
exposure index usually used and that for which an association has been claimed 
is marriage to 
a smoker there being far more data for females than males Some  years agog one of  us PNL 
pointed  out that as smokers tend to marry smokers misclassification of  some current or former

smokers as Iifelong nonsmokers would bias the spousal smoking RR Since then many attempts 
have been made to quantify the bias    O     with conflicting conclusions about its importance 
This paper reviews the issue of  bias from smoking misclassification in ETSlung cancer studies 
Section  considers misclassification in a  x  table assuming no true ETS effect and describes 
the relationship of  the observed spousal smokinglung cancer association to various factors and 
assumptions It is shown that misclassification of  smokers as nonsmokers causes much greater 
bias than misclassification either of  nonsmokers as smokers or of  spousal smoking Restricting 
attention  to  misclassification of  smoking subjects Section  considers the possibility  of  a true 
ETS effect  acting  multiplicatively or  additively with  active  smoking It  also  reveals  errors  in 
published methodologies for bias adjustment  l o  Section  allows for different misclassification 
rates for different types of  smokers and shows how to estimate bias based  on observed rather 
than  true  underlying data Weaknesses in  the  methods  of  the  US  Environmental  Protection 
Agency EPA are demonstrated and an alternative methodology described Using this and the 
complex  set  of  misclassification  rates  used  by  EPA  the  estimated  biases  are  shown  to  be 
virtually the same as those estimated using a single misclassification rate of ever smokers as never 
smokers After considering plausible values of  the betweenspouse smoking concordance rate and 
of  the  eversmokerneversmoker misclassification  rate  the simplified methodology  is  then in 
Section  applied  to US data  In  Section  the  methodology  is  applied  to data from  Asian 
studies accounting  for  possible  higher  misclassification  rates  Section   discusses other issues 
affecting interpretation of  the ETSlung cancer relationship and in  Section  the main findings 
are reviewed and discussed

  Risk of  disease associated with misclassification 

In  Section    misclassification  of  smoking  was  assumed  random  with  the  same  risk  in 
misclassified and correctly classified smokers This may well  be untrue in practice Misclassified

smokers may  have smoked less andor  longer  ago suggesting a  lower  risk  than  smokers who 
report their smoking On the other hand misclassification may be common in subjects who have 
ignored doctors advice to give up smoking following a visit relating to symptoms rendering them 
at higher than average risk 
If correctly classified smokers have w times the risk of misclassified smokers and R  and R are 
their risks relative to true nonsmokers we can solve R  wR and   pR  pR   R to give 
R   R   p     pw and  R   wRp    pw The  observed  active smoking  RR  is then 
given by  R   Ru  puu  pRu R  is usually    R but this need not be so for example if 
p  is small and  u is much larger than  u R  N R  which is   R  if  w   

The observed spousal smoking RR is given by the same formulae as in Sections   with 
R  replaced  by  R   Assuming  the  risk  of  misclassified  smokers  exceeds  that  of  nonsmokers 
positive misclassification bias will  occur 

  Misclassification associated with spousal smoking habits 

The  random  misclassification  assumption  also  means  that  rates  are  independent  of  spousal 
smoking This may  also be  untrue with  people married  to a nonsmoker  less willing to admit 
smoking 
If  the misclassification rate is p when the spouse smokes and p   when  the spouse does not 
E   a  pcb  pIRdb  p  d   a   pRc It is clear p causes positive bias and p   negative 
bias Given p l   E  declines with increasing p    the overall bias ceasing to be positive E   if

  Misclassification of nonsmokers as smokers 
So  far  it  has  been  assumed  no  nonsmokers  are  misclassified  as  smokers  Now  if  q  is  the

Writing p   pl   q it is clear the formula for E is identical to that in Section  with p 
replacing p   Thus for example a    per  cent  misclassification  rate  of  smokers as nonsmokers 
causes the same bias as a   per cent rate in  both  directions Misclassification of  smokers is 
clearly a much more important  cause of  bias than is the reverse misclassification which has no 
effect  on its own  and only slightly reduces the spurious  RR estimate otherwise Because of  this 
and as false claiming of  smoking is probably  quite rare most attempts to quantify the bias have 
ignored this reverse misclassification 

   Misclassification of  spousal smoking 

So  far it has  been assumed  subjects but  not  spouses are misclassified If  r  is the  proportion  of 
smoking spouses misclassified we  have

implying that ignoring misclassification of  spousal smoking only leads to slight overestimation of 
the spousal smoking RR which arises mainly from misclassification of  smoking by  the subject 
The  above  calculations  assume  misclassification  of  subject  and  spousal  smoking  are 
independent If  they are positively correlated which might occur if say both  were reported  by 
the same respondent E would be reduced If  all smokers who deny their smoking also deny their

  Summary 

The  results  above  show  that  misclassification  of  a  subjects  smoking  habits  leads  to 
underestimation  of  the  strength  of  the  active  smokinglung cancer  relationship  and  of  the 
concordance  between  husbands and  wives smoking habits  consistent  with  the  general thesis 
that random misclassification leads to underestimation  of  the strength  of  positive associations 
By contrast providing there is positive concordance between spouses smoking habits random 
misclassification of some subjects who smoke as nonsmokers leads to an apparent relationship of 
spousal  smoking  to  risk  in  nonsmokers  when  no  true  relationship  exists  The  size  of  the

misclassification bias  depends on  the misclassification rate the excess active smoking risk the 
proportion  of  smokers the concordance ratio  and  the proportion  of  spouses who smoke It is 
little affected by  misclassification of  nonsmokers as smokers or of  smoking by  spouses which 
will  be  ignored  hereafter  More  crucial  to  the  size  of  the  bias  are  the  possibilities  that 
misclassification rates may depend  on risk of  disease or on spousal smoking habits If  smokers 
with a relatively low risk of lung cancer or who are married to nonsmokers tend to be more likely 
to deny smoking the bias will  be less than indicated  by  the formula in  Section

  Effect of misclassification on  the active smoking relative risk 

For  the multiplicative model the observed active smoking RR  is given by 
RC   Rc  Ed  pvva   R c    E  b   pRd 
This is biased even without misclassification p   due to failure to adjust for spousal smoking 
When adjustment for spousal smoking is made the active smoking RR will be biased downwards 
by misclassification For example within subjects with nonsmoking spouses the observed active 
smoking RR will  be given by  the expression Ra  pca  pRc which is   R 

For the additive model the observed active smoking RR  is given by 

RZ   Rc   E   R   l  d      P U   U       R c    Eb  p  E   R   d 
The  ratio  of  risks  in  smokers to nonsmokers  among  those  married  to a smoker  is  equal  to 
E  R   lE As this is   R the active smoking RR will be biased downwards even when there 
is no misclassification and when  adjustment  is made for spousal  smoking

Thus any  circumstances causing a given  bias in  the  simple model described in  Section  will 
multiply a true risk associated with spousal smoking by  the same factor 
For the additive model the observed spousal smoking RR is given by 

E  a  pcEb  p  E   R   ldb  a  Rc 
This satisfies E  E t   Given p   E increases with  increasing E starting at the value E  when 
E   The increase in EZ  is less steep than that in E so that EX   E when E   adbc which is 
approximately equal to the concordance ratio k For higher values of  E E  will underestimate E 
though  this  is  unlikely  in  practice  since  estimates  of  concordance  ratio  usually  substantially 
exceed estimates of  spousal smoking relative risk 

  Estimates of  Wald and of  the US National Research Council 

In  Wald et al  and the US National Research Council used an additive model to correct 
spousal smoking RR estimates for bias The methodology used was similar to that described here 
However it was applied using observed data to estimate s  rn and R ignoring the fact that these 
data would themselves be subject to misclassification This resulted in understatement  of the bias 
Thus  Wald  et  al  using  estimates  of  s     p     ml     m   R     and 
E   calculated the observed spousal smoking RR should be   that is an upward bias by 
 per cent In fact after accounting for misclassification appropriate estimates of s mi  and R are 
 and  The observed spousal smoking RR can  then be estimated as   
that is an upward bias by   per cent almost  per cent more than Wald  et  a  calculated

  The WellsStewart method 

In  their  report  the  EPA described  and  used  the  method  of  Wells  and  Stewart  to  correct 
individual  study  RR  estimates  for  smoking  misclassification The  method  has  two  notable 
features First rather  than simply classify subjects as smokers or nonsmokers four groups are 
considered regular occasional former smokers and lifelong nonsmokers The association with 
spousal  smoking  which  remains  classified  in  two  groups  is  studied  in  observed  lifelong 
nonsmokers  which  contain  true  lifelong  nonsmokers  together  with  misclassified  regular 
occasional and former smokers the misclassification rate varying by smoking group Second the 
method  is based  on observed data While in Sections  and   above emphasis is on describing 
how  observed  RRs  depend  on  the  misclassification  rate  given  true  underlying  values  of 
parameters such as s  ml m k E and R the WellsStewart  method  aims at estimating the true 
value of E given assumed misclassification rates and observed values of the parameters including 
the spousal smoking RR 

Elsewhere Lee  discusses the  WellsStewart  method  in  detail  He  points  out  the  method 
depends  on  many  inadequately  explained  and  justified  assumptions  and  imprecisely  known 
parameters and refers to errors in the method Thus i it was assumed totally implausibly that 
the spousal smoking  RR multiplies the former smoking RR but  not  the current  smoking RR 
ii the multiplicative model was  applied to observed  RRs when  logically it would  only  apply 
were it appropriate to true RRs that is RRs before misclassification iii the estimated RR for 
current  versus never smoking was  applied  to current  regular  smoking but  current  smokers 
include  both  regular  and  occasional  smokers iv in  estimating  the  observed  smoking  habit 
distribution of  the cases the frequency of all former smokers longterm and short term has been 
multiplied by  a  risk  factor  derived for  longterm  smokers  only  and  v the actual  method  of

estimating corrected  numbers  of  never  smokers given  the  observed  distribution  of  cases and 
controls  by  self  and  spouses  smoking  habits  and  the  assumed  misclassification  rates  is 
mathematically erroneous 

In the following we describe an alternative procedure which is simpler exact and involves fewer 
assumptions As with the EPA method it estimates E based on observed data and allows various 
categories  of  smokers  to  be  misclassified  though  it  can  also  be  applied  to  the  simple

  The estimation procedure  Step  obtaining observed and true smoking habit distributions for 
controls 

The casecontrol study for which the RR is to be adjusted provides estimates of observed number 
of  never smokers by  spousal smoking a  and b which can be  summed to give u 

Data on the total number of  subjects who smoke t   X u    can be obtained directly in some 
studies  or  indirectly  from  an  estimate  of  smoking  frequency  in  the  population  s  by 
t   su   s  t can then be multiplied by estimates of  the relative frequency of  smoking in 
the n  categories to give  
d f  can then be estimated by  solving c f   d    u  and kf   adbcf 

Given af  bf and u  and estimates of  the concordance ratio for each smoking level kf  cf  and 

This gives the whole of the table for observed controls from which as described in Section  

the table for true controls can then be  estimated 

  The estimation procedure  Step   obtaining smoking habit distributions for cases regardless of 
spouse smoking 

The study for which the RR is  to be  adjusted  provides estimates of  observed numbers of  never 
smokers by spousal smoking A and B which can be summed to give U Given estimates of the 
observed smoking RR in  the various  categories R  estimates  of  V  can  then  be  obtained  by 
Rf   VuvU 

Alternatively if the total number of  smokers in the cases T   XV is known and estimates of 
the  excess risks  of  smoking in  the  various  categories X    relative to category  nX  l are 
available estimates of  V  can  be  obtained  from  n  equations  R   VyuufU  i    n 
R      XR   i      n   l and  T    Z V 

The relationships of  Section  are then used to give U and  V i   the total number of true cases 

subdivided by  subjects smoking 

  The estimation procedure  Step  estimating the true spousal smoking relative risk 
Assume  a  starting  value  of  E  k perhaps  the  observed  value  of  the  spousal  smoking  RR 
i  BaAb  or  a  value  somewhat  less  Solve     BaAb  and  U   A   B 
to  give 
A   aUa  b k   and B  U   A   
For  the  multiplicative  model  Ri  CiaAci Ri  DibBdi and  Ci  D i   V i   Solving  gives 
Ci  AbciViBadi  Abc and hence D i  and  R i   
For  the  additive  model the  second  equation  is  replaced  by  Ri     l   i   DibBdi and 

solving gives 

C i   AcibVik  Bdik  lBadi  Abcik 

and hence D i  and R    

The whole table for true cases has now been obtained and using the relationships in Section 
 the complete table for observed cases can then be estimated If  the estimate of  B  exceeds the 
actual study value assume a lower value of  k if  it  is less try  a higher value 

The whole procedure is then repeated iteratively until the estimate of  B  equals that observed 

This gives the value of  E  adjusted for smoking habit  misclassification 

The relationships of  Section  then allow completion of  the table of  observed case data and 
can be estimated in the normal

observed are as follows

Associated with these data are estimates of   per cent for the observed proportion of  subjects 
who had never smoked and of  and  for the observed spousal and active smoking RRs 

Following to a considerable extent the  EPA  report  we  assume

The concordance  ratio for formernever smokers is  k   
The  concordance  ratios  for  occasionalnever  and  regularfnever  smokers  are  the  same 
k   k 
The observed excess risks for former and occasional smokers are respectively  per cent and

There is a multiplicative model between the true risks

Assumption   is  the main  difference from the  EPA assumptions  Their multiplicative model 

applied to observed rather than true smokers and did not  apply  to current  smokers 

Following Section  with minor adaptation as the concordance ratios are not given level by 
level the data together with assumptions   to  lead to the following table of  observed control 
data

caused upward  bias by  a factor     An  additive model  would lead as shown 
below to a corrected RR of   a bias of   The latter is closer to the EPA bias estimate of

  Simplification of  the  model 

In  the  example  above  the  upward  bias  depends  on  assumed  values  of  six  misclassification 
probabilities To simplify further  work the  relationship of  the  bias to  these probabilities was 
investigated further 

First it was clear the values of the misclassification probabilities from regular or occasional to 
former smokers had  little effect on the  bias Setting these to zero changed the  bias only from 
 to   multiplicative model or from   to   additive 

Second it  was also clear misclassification of  regular smokers as never smokers contributed 
most to the bias With other misclassification rates set to zero and using a multiplicative model 
the biases resulting from misclassification of  regular occasional or former smokers only were 
respectively  and  These represent excess biases that are respectively   
and    per  cent  compared  with  the  bias   associated  with  all  three  misclassification 
probabilities combined These excess biases are in the  ratio       quite close to that 
predicted      by assuming bias is proportional to the product of misclassification rate 
observed  excess  risk  observed  concordance  ratio  and  observed  frequency  of  the  smoking 
category in the controls an approximate formula suggested by  Section  For the additive model 
the biases resulting from misclassification of regular occasional and former smokers only were 
respectively   and  These represent excess biases that are respectively  
and   per cent compared with  the combined bias of   

Thirdly for both multiplicative and additive models the bias from the full analysis described in 
Section  was quite close to that arising from a simpler model with only one smoking level in 
which   per cent of  ever smokers were misclassified as never smokers with the concordance 
ratio  set  as   Thus  for  a  multiplicative model  this  simpler model  gave a  bias  of   
compared with   for the full model For the additive model the simpler model gave  
and the full model   

These general conclusions were confirmed using data from other studies Table I summarizes 
results for the Correa study and for four other large US 
These show misclassifi 
cation to former smokers is unimportant misclassification of  regular smokers as never smokers 
accounts for about  half  of  the total  bias and that  the assumptions used  are similar in effect to 
using the simpler model with a misclassification rate of   per cent and a concordance ratio of 
 The biases for the multiplicative and additive models are similar where the observed spousal

  APPLICATION OF THE METHODOLOGY T O  DATA  FOR US FEMALES 

  Introduction 

The simplified methodology of Section  is now applied to available data for US females Studies 
conducted  in  the US and in  Asia considered in  Section   are the  main  contributors to the 
evidence  and  data  for  females  are much  more  extensive  than  for  males  The  US data  are 
described in Section  followed by discussion in Sections  and  of appropriate ranges of 
concordance ratios and misclassification rates to use The methodology is applied in Section  
and the results  compared with  those  of  others in Section  

  US epidemiological data on lung cancer and spousal smoking in females 

Table  I  summarizes  relevant  data  from   US   t u d i e s        
Data from  one  studyz are 
ignored being based  on only nine lung cancer cases and only  one in ever smokers whose risk 
unusually was less than in never smokers Points to note  about the  studies are 

i  Only  one  study was  prospective  For this  study  number  of  controls are number of 

subjects at the start of  the study 

ii  Most studies concerned all histological  types of lung cancer but three 

z   considered 

specific types only 

iii The index  of  exposure  varied Ten  studies concerned  spousal  smoking but  varied  as to 
whether  smoking of  products  other  than cigarettes  was considered and when  smoking 
    concerned  at home  exposure  not  specifically from the 
occurred  Three  studiesg  
spouse For one study  the index  related  only to heavier exposure

iv The crude spousal RR  corresponds to the   x   table  of  unexposed  and  exposed  never 
smoking controls and cases For the prospective studyz the RR and numbers of controls 
are in fact age standardized crude data not  being presented 

v  Adjusted spousal RRs are as reported with the potential confounding variables considered 

varying by  study 

vi  Some  s t  d i e s                

gave  direct  data  on  numbers  of  ever  smoking  cases  and 
controls from which estimates of proportions of ever smokers and of active smoking RRs 
could be  calculated directly For  other studies estimates were  either  taken  from  other 
publications or shown in  square brackets calculated from other  studies conducted  at 
a similar time 

The data in Table  are as used by EPA  except a three additional studies 

 have been 
included b the  Fontham  et  at study  data  are  updated  from  a  recent  reportI c  for  the 
Garfinkel casecontrol study  data  were  used  for  spouse ever  smoked rather  than  spouse 
smoked at home the former index being more  consistent with  that  used  in  other studies d 
numbers for the Janerich et al 
given for the sexes combined by EPA have been estimated 
separately for females  and e ever smoking RRs have  been  used  for  the  Wu  et  al studyz 
whereas EPA gave current smoking risks 

Ignoring misclassification the data show some evidence of  a positive association for spousal 
smoking Fixedeffects metaanalysis  gives an RR estimate of    per cent CI    for 
the  unadjusted  data  and      per  cent  CI    for  the  covariateadjusted  data  As 
adjustment for covariates had little effect as the misclassification adjustment procedures are not 
designed to  deal  with  data  subdivided by  covariates and  as the  source papers  rarely  if  ever 
present such subdivided data anyway misclassification adjustment will in Sections  and  be 
applied to the data unadjusted for covariates 

  Concordance ratios 

EPA  assumed that for the  x  table subject neverever smoker spouse neverever smoker the 
concordance crossproduct ratio is  and  that for the  x  table subject neverexsmoker 
spouse neverfever smoker is  A value of   for the concordance ratio subject nevercurrent 
smoker spouse neverever smoker was also provided but not used in the adjustment procedure 
as this would lead to over definition 

As support for these estimates EPA cited four 

but gave no detailed data In 
fact the first referene gives no relevant data at all the second  only gives data relevant to 
a different concordance ratio while the third only gives data relevant to the first of  the three 
concordance  ratios  giving  a  value  of    for  women  and    for  men  Only  the  fourth 
reference  gives  a  joint  breakdown  of  smoking  habits  of  subjects  and  spouses  by 
neverexcurrent status and even that was estimated indirectly and suggests concordance ratios 
of     and  rather than   and  

EPA also assumed that for current smokers the association with spousal smoking was the same 
for occasional and regular smokers In fact the only study cited actually showed that the more 
the subject smoked the more likely the subject was to be married to a smoker 

The concordance ratio estimates of  EPA are not solidly based Elsewhere  Lee summarizes 
data  from    studies  Four  provide  estimates  of  the  subject  neverever  smoker  Spouse

concordance ratio which ranged from  to  with a mean of  Based on the  x  table of 
Lee the  noncurrentcurrent  concordance ratio  should  be  about   times higher  than  the 
neverever concordance ratio If so the mean of  for the former ratio implies a value of  for the 
latter ratio rather higher than the mean of  for the four studies providing direct data This look at 
the data suggests an appropriate value of the neverever concordance ratio is almost definitely in the 
range  to  probably below  and probably nearer  than  However we should bear in mind 
there is  highly  significant variation  between  estimates for different studies Concordance  may 
depend  among  other  things  on  national  characteristics the  exact  questions  asked  and  the 
circumstances of interview Limited evidence  suggests no clear relationship with age however 

  Misclassification rates 

Evidence on the extent of  misclassification has been discussed by  Lee     and Wells          
There are two main sources of  data studies in which biochemical markers of  smoke uptake are 
used  to validate statements about current  smoking and  studies in which  statements made on 
different occasions about  smoking are  checked for  consistency It  is  useful  to summarize the 
evidence from these studies so highlighting difficulties in obtaining reliable rate estimates for use 
in adjustment procedures 

As increases in carbon monoxide and thiocyanate commonly occur from sources other than 
smoking  both  Lee  and  Wells  have  restricted  attention  to  studies  using  cotinine  a  major 
metabolite of  nicotine as a  biochemical marker  of  uptake  Although  there are  some  dietary 
sources of nicotine these cannot produce cotinine levels typical even of a light smoker Cotinine 
levels of  current smokers are about two orders of  magnitude higher than those of  ETS exposed 
nonsmokers Although there may be slight overlap between levels in very light smokers and very 
heavily ETSexposed nonsmokers it seems generally accepted that a cutoff of   per cent of the 
level of average smokers can be used to distinguish true smokers A    per cent cutoff is often 
used  to  distinguish  regular  smokers Reviewing  evidence from  cotinine  studies virtually  all 
conducted in the US UK or other Western populations some points emerge 

First misclassified smokers that is selfreported nonsmokers above the cutoff have lower 
cotinine levels than  selfreported smokers occasional smokers more often deny smoking than 
regular smokers but see Section  

Second with similar cutoffs there is wide variation in the proportion of nonsmokers found to 
be  smokers Studies in  which  smokers are advised to give up smoking often report  very  high 
proportions of    per cent Even ignoring such studies as Lee and Wells have done there is 
still marked  heterogeneity proportions  ranging  from  under    per  cent  to  over    per  cent 
Clearly study circumstances affect  misclassification rates and as  the  cotinine  and  ETSlung 
cancer studies may  not  be comparable there is uncertainty in extrapolating results from one 
study type to another Wells  suggests misclassification rates from general population  studies 
may  be  much  higher  than  those  from  epidemiological studies but  this  runs  counter  to  the 
conclusions of  Velicer et d that the less the likelihood of  intervention the greater the accuracy 
of  selfreport In any case the distinction between such study types is unclear 

Many cotinine studies only record current smoking habits and some studies only report data 
for  selfreported  nonsmokers  Misclassification  adjustment  requires  knowledge  not  of  the 
proportion  of  nonsmokers  found  to  be  current  smokers but  of  the  proportion  of  current 
smokers reporting they are Ivefelong  nonsmokers Wells  estimates  per cent of  true regular 
smokers  and    per  cent  of  true  occasional  smokers  are  misclassified  as  never  smokers 
Elsewhere Lee presents data from more studies showing in total   per cent higher rates of 
misclassification of  current smoking

Various studies have compared smoking as reported by subjects on two occasions some years 
apart In a large study in Scotland for example cited by Lee   per cent of  exsmokers and 
  per  cent  of  current  smokers at initial  interview later  claimed never to have  smoked Such 
studies may underestimate misclassification as smokers may deny smoking on both  occasions 
Data from six other studies were summarized by Wells  from which similar estimates of   per 
cent for exsmokers and  per cent for current smokers were calculated The individual study 
estimates varied considerably however for exsmokers ranging from  per cent to  per cent 
Compared  with  subjects  who  consistently  report  being  exsmokers  subjects  reporting  past 
smoking on only one occasion tend to report having given up longer ago and to have smoked less 
when they were moking Because of this Wells in the EPA report  assumed that inconsistent 
exsmokers could be assigned the excess risk of  longterm exsmokes estimated as  per cent of 
that  of  current  smokers  As  some  recent  exsmokers  deny  smoking  this  estimate  may  be 
somewhat too low 

The misclassification estimates of  Wells  are similar in effect to assuming about  per cent of 
average ever smokers are misclassified as never smokers Based on higher misclassification rates 
found in a more extensive data review Lee estimated  per cent would be more appropriate 
Taking into  account  other points  multiple report  studies may  miss subjects denying on each 
occasion some recent exsmokers may  deny smoking the figure would be slightly higher than 
this However there are considerable uncertainties An appropriate figure is probably in the range 
  per cent but  could not implausibly be anywhere in the range    per cent 

Strictly bias  calculations  should  allow for  a  smoker  being more  ready  to deny  his  habit  if 
married  to a nonsmoker The limited data on this  do not suggest this is a major  issue Full 
investigation would require a study with cotinine measured for both  husband  and  wife 

There  is  no  evidence  whether  given  actual  smoking  habits  subjects  who  deny  smoking 
are  more  or  less  at  risk  of  lung  cancer  than  those  who  admit  it  In  a  Danish  prospective 
study Gyntelberg personal communication five  deaths occurred  from ischaemic  heart  disease 
among  men  who  had  reported  not  smoking  but  with  cotinine  levels  consistent  with  current 
smoking  This  compared  with    expected  for  men  of  similar  age  reporting  smoking

  Effect  of  misclassification adjustment on spousal risk  estimates 

Table  IV  presents  metaanalysis  RRs  for  the  US  data  assuming  i  various  levels  of 
misclassification ii various concordance ratios and iii either  a  multiplicative or an additive

a  nonzero  misclassification  with  increasing  concordance  For  low  misclassification  rates 
estimates  from  the  multiplicative  and  additive  models  are  very  similar  but  for  higher 
misclassification  rates  the  additive  model  gives  slightly  lower  RR  estimates  Even  with  an 
estimated misclassification rate as low as  per cent the RR estimate becomes nonsignificant

  Difference from conclusions reached by others 

In  the NRC  summarized data from  studies five in the USA  They estimated an overall 
adjusted  RR  of    per  cent  CI   After misclassification adjustment  the RR  was 
estimated to be about  and at least  Although see Section  the methodology used was 
incorrect the conclusions were similar to those derived from Table IV Thus the NRC suggested 
a bias of     and at most    Applied to the unadjusted US estimate of 
 for the updated  data these biases would  give adjusted figures of   and  The NRC 
conclusion that misclassification bias could not explain the association was not due to inadequate 
adjustment but to the much higher RR they started with In this context it is notable that there 
has  been  a  striking  tendency for more  recent studies to report  lower RRs  Thus while  the   
worldwide studies reporting findings up to  provided a covariateadjusted metaanalysis RR 
estimate of    per  cent  CI  g for  spousal  smoking the   studies reported  later 
provide a RR  estimate of  only    per cent  CI  

The analysis of  Wald et a  also conducted  in   was similar to that of  the NRC  being 
based on the same   studies However as they assumed an exceptionally low misclassification 
rate a lower bias estimate of  only     was calculated 

The recent EPA report  considered data from  US studies with an RR estimate of    
per  cent  CI    reducing to    per  cent CI    after adjustment Assuming 
a  per cent misclassification rate and a concordance ratio of   our analysis reduces an RR 
of    per cent CI   to   per cent CI  There are three main reasons 
why  our misclassification adjusted  RR is much lower than that of  EPA and nonsignificant i 
our analysis includes three studies not considered by  EPAv onei a large study Overall

the three studies show no association with spousal smoking RR    per cent CI  
ii the individual study data we used give slightly lower RRs see Section  Thus our estimate 
for the same  studies EPA used is   per cent CI   rather than  iii the actual 
bias estimated by  EPA of   is substantially  lower than  we  estimate  using apparently 
similar assumptions The most notable difference is for the largest studyI where we estimate  
and the EPA only  This study was unusual as urine samples were used to determine cotinine 
levels As  no  selfreported lifelong nonsmoking  women with  lung  cancer  were  found  to have 
cotinine levels consistent with regular smoking the EPA assumed a misclassification rate of  zero 
for regular smoking for  this study This assumption is wholly  unjustified Urine  samples were 
taken in hospital  after diagnosis Since many  smokers give up smoking at time of  diagnosis of 
lung cancer it is unusual for smoking to be permitted in hospitals and cotinine has a relatively 
short  half  life  of  about  a  day  one  cannot  infer that  none  of  those  cases who  were  regularly 
smoking around  the time of  diagnosis reported  being lifelong never smokers 

  EFFECT O F  MISCLASSIFICATION IN ASIAN FEMALES 

Of    studies of  ETS and lung cancer worldwide  have  been conducted  in Japan China  or 
Hong K  n g     Based on  lung cancer cases in females an overall RR estimate unadjusted for 
covariates or misclassification is a marginally significant   per cent CI   For these 
data  misclassification  adjustment  at  about  the  level  suggested  by  EPA that  is  using  an 
evernever smoker  misclassification  rate  of   per  cent  a  concordance ratio  of   and  an 
additive  model has  very  little  effect reducing  the  RR  only  by   to    per  cent  CI 
  This trivial adjustment as EPA also reported is due to the few Asian  women who 
smoke and the lower RR  when they do However this assumes misclassification rates in Asian 
and  Western  populations  are  similar  as  the  evidence  on  misclassification  comes  almost 
exclusively from Western populations Great doubt has been cast on this assumption by a recent 
of  married Japanese women in which as many as  per cent of current smokers as 
determined by cotinine reported being never smokers The misclassified smokers had very similar 
cotinine  levels  to  smokers  who  admitted  smoking  While  the  circumstances  of  interview 
doortodoor interviews and age range   differed from the ETSJungcancer  studies the 
findings fit  in  with  a  longheld  suspicion that  misclassification  rates  may  be  much  higher  in 
Japanese  than  US  women  smoking  by  women  being  socially  unacceptable  in  Japan 
A concordance ratio of   and a  per cent misclassification rate applied to the overall Asian 
data would totally eliminate the association RR   per cent CI   while even 
a   per  cent  rate  would  render  it  nonsignificant RR    per  cent  CI   The 
Japanese  study  actually  suggested rather  a  higher  concordance than  seen  in  Western  studies 
further emphasizing the importance of  bias due to misclassification 

  OTHER  ISSUES AFFECTING INTERPRETATION  O F  DATA ON ETS 
AND LUNG CANCER 

  Other sources of  bias 

Misclassification of smoking is not the only source of bias relevant to the relationship of  spousal 
smoking to lung cancer Others include 

i Inaccuracy  of  exposure  Misclassification  of  spousal  exposure  will  see  Section   
underestimate  any  true  risk  Also  as  some  nonsmokers  married  to  nonsmokers  are 
exposed to ETS the RR for nonsmokers married to smokers as traditionally  calculated

will underestimate their risk relative to a truly nonexposed population Layard reviews 
the difficulties in adjusting for background  risk 

ii Inaccuracy of diagnosis  Without autopsy a falsepositive clinical diagnosis of lung cancer 
is common In many of the Asian and European studies a high proportion of cases were 
diagnosed without  histological confirmation 

iii Recall  bias  Almost all the ETSlung cancer studies are casecontrol in  which  recall of 

smoking ETS and other exposures may be affected by disease presence 

iv Confounding  For  many  lifestyle risk  factors  for  many  diseases prevalence is  not  only 
increased  in  smokers but  is  also  somewhat increased in  ETSexposed never  smokers 
A  recent  study  concluded  that  confounding by  multiple  risk  factors  may  be  an 
important issue in passive smoking studies 

v  Publication  bias  Spousal smoking RR estimates tend to be lower for studies with  large 
numbers of casess Based on the latest data this difference is significant  p    with 
covariateadjusted RRs of    per cent CI     per cent CI  
and    per cent CI    for studies with respectively more than    
and less than  cases This is consistent with publication bias A technique for carrying 
out a metaanalysis whilst adjusting for publication bias has been proposed 

vi  Study quality  Elsewhere Lee defined a study as having a serious weakness if any of seven 
criteria were present   studies can be  classified inferior using these criteria including 
 out of   of the studies with the highest RRs The overall RR adjusted for covariates for 
the inferior studies is   per cent CI  significantly p   greater than 
that  for  the    superior studies which  at      per  cent  CI    show  no 
significant association with spousal smoking 

  Evidence from other indices of  ETS exposure 

Early  ETSlung  cancer  studies  presented  data  only  for  husbands  smoking  and  published 
metaanalyses have tended to concentrate on this index This includes the  EPA report  which 
considered these results at length but did not give even basic results for any other index although 
considerable evidence has accumulated for workplace and childhood ETS exposure Based on  
individual sexspecific RR  estimates from    studies a  combined  RR  estimate  adjusted  for 
covariates for workplace exposure is   per cent CI  Based on  estimates from 
  studies the  RR  estimate for  childhood  exposure  is      per  cent  CI    This 
compares with     per  cent  CI   based  on    studies for  husbands  smoking 
Concentration  on  the index showing an  association at the expense of  others which  do not is 
a  major  form  of  publication  bias  Two  alternative extreme views  of  the  conflict  between the 
spousal and the workplacechildhood results are possible One is that spousal smoking is much 
more susceptible than the other indices to misclassification and perhaps also confounding bias 
as concordance is much stronger for spouses than for coworkers or for parents and their children 
The other is that working with a smoker and having a parent smoke in childhood are both very 
poor markers of actual exposure spousal smoking finding an association as it is the only adequate 
marker  This  second  explanation  seems  weak  Working  with  a  smoker  is  clearly  correlated 
with increased ETS exposure though probably less so than is marriage to a smoker and if  ETS 
exposure really increased risk an association with lung cancer incidence would be expected 

  Doseresponse  relationships 

Our  methodology compares  risk  in  nonsmokers  according  to  whether  or  not  the  husband 
smoked  regardless  of  how  much  he  smoked  The  EPA  report  stressed  the  existence  of

P LEE AND B FOREY 

a doseresponse  relationship with RR estimates generally highest in the women whose husbands 
smoked the most In interpreting this finding it should be noted that studies reporting relatively 
high  RRs for spousal smoking are much  more  likely to present  data by  amount  smoked  than 
those  that  do  not  Thus  for  the    studies  which  presented  doseresponse  data  the  overall 
spousal  smoking  RR  adjusted  for  covariates  was      per  cent  CI    highly 
significantly  p    greater than the RR  of    per cent CI   for the  studies 
which  did  not  This  form  of  publication  bias  means  RR  estimates  for  nonsmoking  women 
married  to heavily  smoking husbands  are strongly  biased  upward  It  may  also  be  that  given 
a choice of  indices of  ETS exposure an author may only present detailed findings for the index 
showing the  clearest  trend  Other  biases  may  affect  the  doseresponse  relationship  Thus  as 
concordance increases with amount smoked smoking misclassification will also contribute to the 
observed dose response 

  Histological type 

The association of lung cancer with active smoking is much greater for squamous carcinoma than 
for adenocarcinoma  If  ETS is  seen crudely as a  smaller dose  of  active smoking it  might  be 
expected had it any effect at all to be more strongly associated with risk of  squamous carcinoma 
Findings for those ETSlung cancer studies reporting  results separately by  histological type do 
not fit in with this expectation While for some studies the results do seem more consistent with 
a relationship with squamous carcinoma there are an equal number where the relationship seems 
more with adenocarcinoma as well  as some studies with similar or a lack of relationship  with 
either 

  Plausibility 

Active smoking is strongly associated with risk of  lung cancer and ETS and mainstream  smoke 
contain many chemicals in common albeit in different relative concentrations It can be argued 
especially by  adherents of  the nothreshold hypothesis that  an association of  ETS with  lung 
cancer is to be  expected However the amount  of  particulate matter tar  retained  by  passive 
smokers is thousands of  times lower than that retained by active smokers If as many believe tar 
retention is relevant to lung carcinogenesis and the doseresponse  relationship is approximately 
linear the observed spousal smoking RR about   would be much higher than expected 
on  dosimetric  grounds  about    Based  on  this  argument  most  of  the  observed 
association could be  due to bias 

  DISCUSSION 

Misclassification of  smoking habits  leads to underestimation  of  the association  of  lung cancer 
with active smoking Given positive concordance  between smoking habits of  spouses however 
random  misclassification of  some smokers as nonsmokers  will  result in  overestimation  of  the 
association of  lung cancer with ETS in studies of  nonsmokers where marriage to a smoker is the 
index of  exposure Sections  and   show how  this bias depends on various factors It tends to 
increase  with  an  increasing  misclassification  rate  of  smokers  as  nonsmokers  concordance 
proportion  of  subjects who smoke and proportion  of  spouses who  smoke Misclassification of 
nonsmoking subjects as smokers or of  smoking by  spouses has little effect on the bias and the 
mathematics is simplified by ignoring these possibilities Bias estimates can be materially affected 
if  misclassification  of  smoking is  not  random  Section  accounts for  one  important  form  of 
nonrandomness  arising as current  regular  smokers are less likely to deny  smoking  than  are

occasional  or  longterm  exsmokers  However  various  other  mechanisms  may  cause 
nonrandomness If for example smokers tend to be much more likely to deny smoking if  their 
spouse does not smoke the bias will be reduced and may even be reversed If on the other hand 
smokers who  are ill  and  at more  risk  of  developing lung cancer  are also  more  likely to deny 
smoking the bias may be increased Without hard data indicating the existence or importance of 
these forms of  nonrandonness we make no attempt to account for them However there is need 
for further research here for example a  study  where smoking by  husbands  and wives is both 
assessed and separately validated  using cotinine assays 

Section   considers  the  possibility that  misclassification may  vary  by  type  of  smoker and 
improves  the  correction  method  used  by  EPA  which  has  numerous  errors  Given  known 
misclassification rates and concordance ratios and various other assumptions the methodology 
allows estimation of  true numbers of  cases and controls in the various smoking categories from 
the observed data and hence of  the misclassificationadjusted RR  associated with  marriage to 
a  smoker  RR  estimates  for  individual  studies  can  then  be  metaanalysed  This  method  is 
problematic due to the large number of misclassification rates and concordance ratios assumed 
with data sparse or nonexistent for many of  them Luckily matters are simplified by noting see 
Section  that for many studies the bias implied by the assumed values of the misclassification 
rates and concordance ratios is virtually identical to that implied by  a simpler model with only 
two  smoking  categories  never  ever  a  single  misclassification  rate  of    and  a  single 
concordance ratio of   

In Section  this simpler model is applied to data for US females With the misclassification 
rate of   and concordance ratio of  a marginally significant unadjusted metaanalysis RR of 
 drops to a nonsignificant   In fact the misclassification rate could well be higher than 
 per cent further reducing the RR estimate Though there is some doubt as to the appropriate 
rate misclassification can certainly explain most of  the observed association of  spousal smoking 
with  lung cancer 

As  fewer Asian  women  smoke and  have  lower active smoking  RRs  when  they  do a  given 
misclassification rate will cause far less bias in Asian than US studies However evidence which 
needs  replicating from  Japan  suggests misclassification  rates  may  be  much  higher  in  Asian 
women  If  so  misclassification  may  cause  marked  bias  there  Until  results  of  the  IARC 
multicentre study are published European data are rather  sparse and are not considered here 
Misclassification is only one reason to be wary of  accepting the association of lung cancer risk 
with spousal smoking as indicative of  a true effect of  ETS As  discussed in  Section   there are 
other sources of  bias such as confounding There is also evidence of  a lack of  association  with 
workplace  or  childhood  ETS  exposure The  very  low  particulate  matter  retention  of  passive 
smokers also suggests the association with spousal smoking may  be  mainly an artefact 

Our paper emphasizes the difficulties of  interpreting weak associations in epidemiology and 
the need to quantify the various sources of  bias before coming to a firm conclusion Though there 
are difficulties in  quantifying the exact effects of  smoking habit  misclassification our analyses 
show its likely importance and cast doubt on simple interpretation  of  the association  between 
lung cancer and spousal smoking as indicative of  a cause and effect relationship
