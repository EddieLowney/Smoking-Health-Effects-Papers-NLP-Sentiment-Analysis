SUMMARY
The relationship of environmental tobacco smoke to lung cancer risk in lifelong non-smokers is commonly
studied using marriage to a smoker as the index of exposure. As smokers tend to marry smokers, relative risk
estimates will be biased if some current or former smokers are misclassified as lifelong non-smokers. This
paper shows how various factors affect the magnitude of the bias and describes a method for obtaining
misclassification-adjusted relative risk estimates. Application of the method to U.S. and Asian data for
women suggests misclassification is an important determinant of the slight excess risk observed in
non-smokers married to smokers. Reasons why our conclusions differ from those of others are discussed, as
are other difficulties in interpreting the association between spousal smoking and lung cancer risk.
1. INTRODUCTION
Error in the variables studied can bias the relationship of a risk factor to a disease. In 2 x 2 tables,
random misclassification of exposure or disease biases relative risk (RR) estimate towards
unity.'-3 How the bias relates to the misclassification rate, and the disease and exposure
frequency has been de~cribedA.~d ditional information on accuracy of exposure data can be used
to obtain unbiased RR estimates.'
Random misclassification of exposure understates true associations, but random
misclassification of confounding variables may not. How misclassification affects- R R estimates
adjusted for a single confounder with two levels has been With large ( 30 per cent)
errors in the confounder, adjustment has little effect. Even for smaller (- 10 per cent) errors,
about half the confounding effect remains after adjustment. Tzonou et aL6 note that 'Generally, in
the presence of strong risk factors which have potentially large confounding effects and which
may have been imprecisely measured, the etiological significance of factors observed to be
relatively weakly associated with disease must be treated with caution.
Since 1981, the possible association of lung cancer with environmental tobacco smoke (ETS)
exposure has been extensively studied. Since this association, if it existed, would be much weaker
than that with active smoking, and since it is hard to quantify precisely the many aspects of active
smoking correlated with risk, ETS studies usually consider only lifelong non-smokers. The
exposure index usually used, and that for which an association has been claimed,'.' is marriage to

This paper reviews the issue of bias from smoking misclassification in ETS/lung cancer studies.
Section 2 considers misclassification in a 2 x 2 table assuming no true ETS effect, and describes
the relationship of the observed spousal smoking/lung cancer association to various factors and
assumptions. It is shown that misclassification of smokers as non-smokers causes much greater
bias than misclassification, either of non-smokers as smokers or of spousal smoking. Restricting
attention to misclassification of smoking subjects, Section 3 considers the possibility of a true
ETS effect, acting multiplicatively or additively with active smoking. It also reveals errors in
published methodologies for bias adjustment.” lo Section 4 allows for different misclassification
rates for different types of smokers, and shows how to estimate bias based on observed rather
than true underlying data. Weaknesses in the methods of the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA)8 are demonstrated, and an alternative methodology described. Using this, and the
complex set of misclassification rates used by EPA,’ the estimated biases are shown to be
virtually the same as those estimated using a single misclassification rate, of ever smokers as never
smokers. After considering plausible values of the between-spouse smoking concordance rate and
of the ever-smoker/never-smoker misclassification rate, the simplified methodology is then, in
by
Section 5, applied to US. data. In Section 6 the methodology is applied to data from Asian Northeastern
studies, accounting for possible higher misclassification rates. Section 7 discusses other issues
affecting interpretation of the ETS/lung cancer relationship, and in Section 8 the main findings University,
are reviewed and discussed.

The association of husbands’ and wives’ smoking habits is often measured by the concordance

smokers and the concordance ratio (here parameterized indirectly by z) and decreases with the (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions)

causes the same bias as a 5.26 per cent rate in both directions. Misclassification of smokers is
clearly a much more important cause of bias than is the reverse misclassification, which has no
effect on its own and only slightly reduces the spurious RR estimate otherwise. Because of this,
and as false claiming of smoking is probably quite rare, most attempts to quantify the bias have
ignored this reverse misclassification.

little affected by misclassification of non-smokers as smokers, or of smoking by spouses, which
will be ignored hereafter. More crucial to the size of the bias are the possibilities that
misclassification rates may depend on risk of disease or on spousal smoking habits. If smokers
with a relatively low risk of lung cancer or who are married to non-smokers tend to be more likely
to deny smoking, the bias will be less than indicated by the formula in Section 2.4.

approximately equal to the concordance ratio k. For higher values of E, E: will underestimate E,
though this is unlikely in practice since estimates of concordance ratio usually substantially
exceed estimates of spousal smoking relative risk.
3.4. Estimates of Wald and of the US National Research Council
In 1986, Wald et al." and the US National Research Council7 used an additive model to correct
spousal smoking RR estimates for bias. The methodology used was similar to that described here.
However, it was applied using observed data to estimate s, rn, and R, ignoring the fact that these
data would themselves be subject to misclassification. This resulted in understatement of the bias.
Thus, Wald et al.," using estimates of s = 050, p = 0.07, ml = 0.59, m2 = 0-81, R = 2 and by

In the following we describe an alternative procedure which is simpler, exact and involves fewer
assumptions. As with the EPA method, it estimates E based on observed data, and allows various
categories of smokers to be misclassified (though it can also be applied to the simple
smoker/non-smoker case).

Let subjects who smoke be categorized into n increasing levels (i = 1, ... ,n). The notation
previously used is extended by a subscript for smoking level. The true distribution of smoking in

Evidence on the extent of misclassification has been discussed by Lee”. and Wells.’.

There are two main sources of data, studies in which biochemical markers of smoke uptake are
used to validate statements about current smoking, and studies in which statements made on
different occasions about smoking are checked for consistency. It is useful to summarize the
evidence from these studies, so highlighting difficulties in obtaining reliable rate estimates for use
by
in adjustment procedures. Northeastern
As increases in carbon monoxide and thiocyanate commonly occur from sources other than
smoking, both Lee and Wells have restricted attention to studies using cotinine, a major University,
metabolite of nicotine, as a biochemical marker of uptake. Although there are some dietary

the
conducted in the U.S., U.K. or other Western populations, some points emerge. Terms
First, misclassified smokers (that is, self-reported non-smokers above the cut-off) have lower and
cotinine levels than self-reported smokers; occasional smokers more often deny smoking than Conditions
regular smokers (but see Section 6).
(https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions)
Second, with similar cut-offs there is wide variation in the proportion of non-smokers found to
be smokers. Studies in which smokers are advised to give up smoking often report very high
proportions of 15-40 per cent. Even ignoring such studies, as Lee and Wells have done, there is
still marked heterogeneity, proportions ranging from under 1 per cent to over 6 per cent.”
Clearly, study circumstances affect misclassification rates, and, as the cotinine and ETS/lung
cancer studies may not be comparable, there is uncertainty in extrapolating results from one
study type to another. Wells’ suggests misclassification rates from ‘general population studies’
may be much higher than those from ‘epidemiological studies’, but this runs counter to the

Various studies have compared smoking as reported by subjects on two occasions, some years from
apart. In a large study in Scotland, for example, cited by Lee,” 10.1 per cent of ex-smokers and https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0258(19960330)15:6<581::AID-SIM182>3.0.CO;2-B
2.5 per cent of current smokers at initial interview later claimed never to have smoked. Such
studies may underestimate misclassification, as smokers may deny smoking on both occasions.
Data from six other studies were summarized by Wells,’ from which similar estimates of 11.7 per
cent for ex-smokers and 3-9 per cent for current smokers were calculated. The individual study
estimates varied considerably, however, for ex-smokers ranging from 0.0 per cent to 26.8 per cent.
Compared with subjects who consistently report being ex-smokers, subjects reporting past
smoking on only one occasion tend to report having given up longer ago and to have smoked less
when they were ~moking.~B’e cause of this, Wells, in the EPA report,’ assumed that inconsistent
ex-smokers could be assigned the excess risk of long-term ex-smokes, estimated as 9 per cent of
that of current smokers. As some recent ex-smokers deny smoking this estimate may be
somewhat too low.
The misclassification estimates of Wells’ are similar in effect to assuming about 1-75 per cent of
average ever smokers are misclassified as never smokers. Based on higher misclassification rates
found in a more extensive data review, Lee33e stimated 2.5 per cent would be more appropriate.
Taking into account other points (multiple report studies may miss subjects denying on each
by
occasion; some recent ex-smokers may deny smoking), the figure would be slightly higher than Northeastern
this. However, there are considerable uncertainties. An appropriate figure is probably in the range
2-3 per cent but could, not implausibly, be anywhere in the range 1-4 per cent. University,

5.5. Effect of misclassification adjustment on spousal risk estimates
Table IV presents meta-analysis RRs for the U.S. data assuming: (i) various levels of
misclassification; (ii) various concordance ratios; and (iii) either a multiplicative or an additive
model. The combined RR risk estimate decreases with increasing misclassification, and (for
a non-zero misclassification) with increasing concordance. For low misclassification rates,
estimates from the multiplicative and additive models are very similar, but for higher
misclassification rates, the additive model gives slightly lower RR estimates. Even with an
on
estimated misclassification rate as low as 0.5 per cent, the RR estimate becomes non-significant. Wiley
For a rate of 1-75 per cent and a concordance ratio of 3.0, shown above to give results comparable Online

5.6. Difference from conclusions reached by others
See
In 1986 the NRC' summarized data from 13 studies, five in the U.S.A. They estimated an overall the
Terms
adjusted RR of 1-34 (95 per cent CI 1-18-153). After misclassification adjustment the RR was
and
estimated to be about 1.25, and at least 1.15. Although (see Section 3.4) the methodology used was Conditions
incorrect, the conclusions were similar to those derived from Table IV. Thus the NRC suggested
(https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions)
a bias of 1.34/1.25 = 1.07 and at most 1.34/1.15 = 1.17. Applied to the unadjusted US.e stimate of
1.13 for the updated data, these biases would give adjusted figures of 1.06 and 0.97. The NRC
conclusion that misclassification bias could not explain the association was not due to inadequate
adjustment but to the much higher RR they started with. In this context, it is notable that there
has been a striking tendency for more recent studies to report lower RRs. Thus, while the 22
worldwide studies reporting findings up to 1988 provided a covariate-adjusted meta-analysis RR
estimate of 1.35 (95 per cent CI 1.2g1.52) for spousal smoking, the 15 studies reported later
provide a RR estimate of only 1.01 (95 per cent CI 091-1.11).
on
The analysis of Wald et a/." also conducted in 1986, was similar to that of the NRC, being Wiley
based on the same 13 studies. However, as they assumed an exceptionally low misclassification Online
rate, a lower bias estimate of only 1.35/1.30 = 1.04 was calculated. Library

the three studies show no association with spousal smoking (RR = 1.01; 95 per cent CI 0.82-1.23); from
(ii) the individual study data we used give slightly lower RRs (see Section 5.2). Thus our estimate https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0258(19960330)15:6<581::AID-SIM182>3.0.CO;2-B
for the same 11 studies EPA used is 1-20( 95 per cent CI 1.05-1.38) rather than 1.22; (iii) the actual
bias estimated by EPA, of 1.03, is substantially lower than we estimate, 1.08, using apparently
similar assumptions. The most notable difference is for the largest study,I6 where we estimate 1.08
and the EPA only 1.01. This study was unusual as urine samples were used to determine cotinine
levels. As no self-reported lifelong non-smoking women with lung cancer were found to have
cotinine levels consistent with regular smoking, the EPA assumed a misclassification rate of zero
for regular smoking for this study. This assumption is wholly unjustified. Urine samples were
taken in hospital after diagnosis. Since many smokers give up smoking at time of diagnosis of
lung cancer, it is unusual for smoking to be permitted in hospitals, and cotinine has a relatively
short half life of about a day, one cannot infer that none of those cases who were regularly
smoking around the time of diagnosis reported being lifelong never smokers.
6. EFFECT OF MISCLASSIFICATION IN ASIAN FEMALES
Of 37 studies of ETS and lung cancer worldwide, 16 have been conducted in Japan, China or
by
Hong K~ng.~Ba's ed on 1918 lung cancer cases in females, an overall RR estimate, unadjusted for Northeastern
covariates or misclassification, is a marginally significant 1.16 (95 per cent CI 1.03-1.31). For these
data, misclassification adjustment at about the level suggested by EPA8 (that is, using an University,
ever/never smoker misclassification rate of 1.75 per cent, a concordance ratio of 3-0, and an
Wiley
additive model) has very little effect, reducing the RR only by 001 to 1.15 (95 per cent CI
Online
1.02-1.30). This trivial adjustment, as EPA8 also reported, is due to the few Asian women who

exclusively from Western populations. Great doubt has been cast on this assumption by a recent
of 400 married Japanese women, in which as many as 20.8 per cent of current smokers (as See
determined by cotinine) reported being never smokers. The misclassified smokers had very similar the
Terms
cotinine levels to smokers who admitted smoking. While the circumstances of interview
and
(door-to-door interviews) and age range (2&55) differed from the ETSJung-cancer studies, the Conditions
findings fit in with a long-held suspicion that misclassification rates may be much higher in
(https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions)
Japanese than U.S. women, smoking by women being socially unacceptable in Japan.
A concordance ratio of 3.0 and a 20 per cent misclassification rate applied to the overall Asian
data would totally eliminate the association (RR = 0.99,95 per cent CI = 0.87-1-12), while even
a 10 per cent rate would render it non-significant (RR = 1.09, 95 per cent CI 0.97-1.23). The
Japanese study actually suggested rather a higher concordance than seen in Western studies,
further emphasizing the importance of bias due to misclassification.

(ii) Inaccuracy of diagnosis. Without autopsy, a false-positive clinical diagnosis of lung cancer

increased in smokers, but is also somewhat increased in ETS-exposed never smokers.

individual sex-specific RR estimates from 12 studies, a combined RR estimate (adjusted for
covariates) for workplace exposure is 1.00 (95 per cent CI 0-91-1.08). Based on 15 estimates from (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions)

Concentration on the index showing an association, at the expense of others which do not, is
a major form of publication bias. Two alternative extreme views of the conflict between the
spousal and the workplace/childhood results are possible. One is that spousal smoking is much
more susceptible than the other indices to misclassification, and perhaps also confounding, bias
as concordance is much stronger for spouses than for co-workers or for parents and their children.

a dose-response relationship, with RR estimates generally highest in the women whose husbands from

high RRs for spousal smoking are much more likely to present data by amount smoked than
those that do not. Thus, for the 19 studies which presented dose-response data, the overall
spousal smoking RR (adjusted for covariates) was 1.36 (95 per cent CI 1.23-1-51), highly
significantly (p < 0.001) greater than the RR of 093 (95 per cent CI 0.83-1.04) for the 18 studies
which did not. This form of publication bias means RR estimates for non-smoking women
married to heavily smoking husbands are strongly biased upward. It may also be that, given
a choice of indices of ETS exposure, an author may only present detailed findings for the index
showing the clearest trend. Other biases may affect the dose-response relationship. Thus, as
concordance increases with amount smoked, smoking misclassification will also contribute to the
observed dose response.
7.4. Histological type
The association of lung cancer with active smoking is much greater for squamous carcinoma than
for adenocarcinoma. If ETS is seen, crudely, as a smaller dose of active smoking, it might be
expected, had it any effect at all, to be more strongly associated with risk of squamous carcinoma. by

on dosimetric grounds (about 1.01-1.02). Based on this argument, most of the observed

Misclassification of smoking habits leads to underestimation of the association of lung cancer
with active smoking. Given positive concordance between smoking habits of spouses, however,

occasional or long-term ex-smokers. However, various other mechanisms may cause from
non-randomness. If, for example, smokers tend to be much more likely to deny smoking if their https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0258(19960330)15:6<581::AID-SIM182>3.0.CO;2-B
spouse does not smoke, the bias will be reduced and may even be reversed. If, on the other hand,
smokers who are ill and at more risk of developing lung cancer are also more likely to deny
smoking, the bias may be increased. Without hard data indicating the existence or importance of
these forms of non-randonness, we make no attempt to account for them. However, there is need
for further research here, for example, a study where smoking by husbands and wives is both
assessed and separately validated using cotinine assays.
Section 4 considers the possibility that misclassification may vary by type of smoker, and
improves the correction method used by EPA, which has numerous errors. Given known
misclassification rates and concordance ratios, and various other assumptions, the methodology
allows estimation of true numbers of cases and controls in the various smoking categories from
the observed data, and hence of the misclassification-adjusted RR associated with marriage to
a smoker. RR estimates for individual studies can then be meta-analysed. This method is
problematic due to the large number of misclassification rates and concordance ratios assumed,
with data sparse or non-existent for many of them. Luckily matters are simplified by noting (see
Section 4.7) that for many studies the bias implied by the assumed values of the misclassification

Misclassification is only one reason to be wary of accepting the association of lung cancer risk
with spousal smoking as indicative of a true effect of ETS. As discussed in Section 7, there are
other sources of bias (such as confounding). There is also evidence of a lack of association with
workplace or childhood ETS exposure. The very low particulate matter retention of passive
smokers also suggests the association with spousal smoking may be mainly an artefact.
Our paper emphasizes the difficulties of interpreting weak associations in epidemiology, and
the need to quantify the various sources of bias before coming to a firm conclusion. Though there
are difficulties in quantifying the exact effects of smoking habit misclassification, our analyses
