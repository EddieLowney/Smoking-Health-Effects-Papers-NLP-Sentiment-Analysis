Electronic cigarettes ecigarettes ecigs or electronic nicotine
delivery systems are batteryoperated devices typically
containing glycerol andor propylene glycolbased solutions with
varying nicotine content known as eliquids Although
ecigarettes were originally developed as a potentially less
harmful alternative to traditional combustible tobacco cigarette
smokers several factors have driven their popularity among
smokers and nonsmokers alike including their sleek product
designs innumerable appealing avors lack of combustible
smoke and odor and high potential nicotine concentrations
Furthermore many advocates have promoted the idea that
ecigarettes are safe to use or at least safer than conventional
tobacco despite limited longitudinal data to support these
claims Here we examine what is known about the impacts of
ecigarette use on traditional cigarette smoking cessation lung
health and youth and young adult tobacco product exposure
Upon review of the currently available literature the negative
effects of ecigarette use seem to outweigh any potential benet
because the available evidence does not conrm the use of
ecigarettes as an effective strategy for supporting traditional
combustible tobacco cigarette smoking cessation particularly
given the emerging adverse effects on lung health and the
potential future public health effects of ecigarette adoption
among a burgeoning new generation of tobacco product

INTRODUCTION

Electronic cigarettes also known as ecigarettes ecigs or
electronic nicotine delivery systems
ENDS are battery
operated nicotine delivery devices typically lled with glycerol
and propylene glycolbased solutions with varying nicotine
content known as eliquids Although ecigarettes were his
torically developed to supplant traditional combustible tobacco
use with a less harmful alternative several factors have driven
ecigarette popularity including their many appealing avors the
lack of combustible smoke and odor sleek proles and high
potential nicotine concentrations Furthermore many consumers
and advocates have promoted the idea that ecigarettes are safe to
use or at least safer than conventional tobacco However limited
longitudinal data exist to support those suppositions given the
relatively recent emergence of ecigarettes as a prominent tobacco
product Here we examine what is known about the impacts of
ecigarette use on traditional cigarette smoking cessation lung
health and youth and young adult tobacco product exposure

ELECTRONIC CIGARETTE USE AND SMOKING
CESSATION
Development and current use

The earliest patent for an ecigarette was granted in August
 to Herbert A Gilbert US Patent No  who
designed a smokeless nontobacco cigarette with multiple avor
options yet without nicotine with the intent of replacing the
combustible tobacco cigarette with a safer less harmful alterna
tive However
in focus groups run by tobacco companies
smokers did not nd the aerosol produced by Gilberts device
appealing
likely because of the absence of nicotine and the
subsequent inability to activate the dopamine reward system
The device never made it to market

In the mids the modern ecigarette was invented and
use skyrocketed in popularity in the United States and Europe
especially among youths and young adults Some factors driving
these products include the availability of
the popularity of
thousands of avors allowing for a personalized product selec
tion minimal regulation by the government resulting in the
perception of their being less harmful than combustible tobacco
products and extensive marketing by manufacturers as
smoking cessation aids However to date no clear consensus

has emerged regarding the utility of ecigarettes for smoking

and Drug Administration FDA Center for Drug Evaluation
and Research for this purpose Although several randomized

Ecigarettes as smoking cessation aids

Shortterm studies less than  year published to address the
efcacy of ecigarettes as smoking cessation aids have yielded
dichotomous results A  Cochrane analysis evaluated
the effect of ecigarette consumer product use on smoking
cessation and found that in all adult smokers odds ratio OR 
  CI  and smokers motivated to quit
smoking OR    CI  ecigarette
consumer product use was not signicantly associated with a
higher quit rate In contrast quit rates were higher in cigarette
smokers who used ecigarettes daily OR    CI
 relative to smokers who use ecigarettes less than
daily OR    CI  When pre
scribed as smoking cessation aids and administered free of cost in
randomized control trials ecigarettes offer little benet over
usual care or no treatment

Furthermore in the longest observational study performed to
date Flacco et al found no evidence that ecigarette use
increased smoking cessation rates over a year period 
 nor was there evidence of harm reduction in ecigarette or
dual users those using both ecigarettes and combustible ciga
rettes compared with cigarette smokers Abstinence from
combustible tobacco use was assessed with exhaled carbon
monoxide testing in  ecigarette users all exsmokers 
cigarette smokers and  dual users Among ecigarette users
 remained tobacco abstinent Tobacco cessation rates were
equivalent in both dual users and tobacco smokers  vs
 respectively The authors found that although the
switch from combustible cigarettes to ecigarettes supported
abstinence from conventional cigarette use the continued used
of ecigarettes in addition to smoking cigarettes did not improve
smoking cessation or reduction

Ecigarettes and the harm reduction principle

Harm reduction via ecigarette use has also been evaluated by
measuring tobaccospecic toxicants and carcinogens Like cig
arettes aerosols from ecigarettes have been found to contain
nicotine nitrosamines carbonyl compounds heavy metals and
particulate matter Although present in smaller quantities
compared with combustible tobacco products these chemicals
are wellknown for their addictive nature and toxicity In the
national cohort Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health
PATH study including  participants consisting of exclu
sive cigarette smokers
 exclusive ecigarette users
 and dual users  from waves  and  ve urinary
biomarkers were
regression
models  nicotine metabolites and minor tobacco alkaloids 
tobaccospecic nitrosamines
 metals heavy metals and
speciated arsenic  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and 

examined using multivariable

volatile organic compounds Switching from exclusive cigarette
use to exclusive ecigarette use  resulted in a decreased
urinary toxicant content however most participants maintained
exclusive ecigarette use or became dual users of combustible
cigarettes and ecigarettes In these individuals levels of urinary
toxicants did not decrease Most dual users maintained dual
use status  or transitioned back to exclusive combus
tible cigarette use   year later The authors concluded
that ecigarettes tended to be used as supplements to conven
tional cigarettes resulting in dual use and reduced efcacy as
smoking cessation aids

Ecigarettes and nicotine replacement therapy

Treatment with nicotine replacement therapy NRT and
combination therapies for smoking cessation achieves absti
nence rates of approximately  at  months and  at 
year Compared with traditional NRT epidemiologic
studies show that ecigarettes can be more effective than NRT
alone in achieving smoking cessation Walker and colleagues
examined the effects of dual NRT using nicotine patches and
nicotinecontaining ecigarettes compared with nicotine patches
alone and nicotinefree ecigarettes Unfortunately a control
cohort using ecigarettes alone was not included in the study
design Exhaled carbon monoxide was used to verify continuous
combustible tobacco abstinence at  months Participants in the
nicotine patches and nicotine ecigarette group had a modestly
higher quit rate  than those in the nicotine patches and
nicotinefree ecigarette group  risk difference  
 CI  The group treated with nicotine patches
and nicotine
total nicotine
replacement levels compared with the patchesalone group
which may explain the slightly higher abstinence rate such that
the role of the specic nicotine delivery system was not directly
assessed in this study The quit rate in the nicotine patches
alone groups was  risk difference    CI 
 which is extremely low compared with similar NRT
studies This raises concerns regarding the study design and the
presence of extratreatment factors that adversely inuenced
NRT

received higher

ecigarettes

The nding that ecigarettes are superior to NRT in achieving
smoking cessation was also noted in a  study in which 
adult smokers were randomly assigned to receive either NRT
n   or a nicotinecontaining ecigarette starter pack n 
 In this study participants also received weekly facetoface
counseling for  year The primary outcome was sustained
smoking abstinence at  weeks The authors found that  of
participants who used ecigarettes for smoking cessation aids
were no longer smoking conventional
tobacco a year later
compared with  of participants who used NRT to quit
smoking relative risk    CI  P  
However among ecigarette users   were still vaping

only  of participants in the NRT group still using NRT four

Ecigarettes and addictive potential

The addictive potential of ecigarettes was evaluated in
another  study using the Fagerstrom test for nicotine
dependence a item questionnaire modied to analyze nico
tine dependence and patterns and attitudes toward using ecig
arettes and combustible cigarettes Thirty ecigarette users 
smokers and  dual users were evaluated Habits and behaviors
associated with using ecigarettes did not differ signicantly be
tween exclusive ecigarette users and dual users Surprisingly
nicotine dependence as measured using the Fagerstrom test for
nicotine dependence was twice as high in ecigarette users mean
 compared with traditional cigarette smokers mean  P 
 afrming that ecigarettes can be powerful activators of
nicotine addiction pathways in the brain and that using these
devices can convey an addictive potential similar to conventional
tobacco products

Equally disturbing are further data from the PATH cohort
study examining the addictive potential of ecigarettes in 
adult former tobacco smokers from waves  to  
Adult former smokers who reported using ecigarettes after
wave  and who had not used traditional cigarettes during
wave  of the PATH trial were found to be at increased risk

A separate analysis of  adults completing two waves of
PATH  and  also showed that ecigarette
use increased rates of new combustible tobacco product use in
adults compared with adults who had never used ecigarettes P
  Adults who had never used ecigarettes at baseline but
reported ever trying ecigarettes were four times as likely to have
transitioned to ever smoking combustible cigarettes than never
smokers who had not used ecigarettes OR    CI 
 Adults who used ecigarettes in the past  days were six
times as likely to have transitioned from never to ever combus
tible cigarette smokers OR    CI   and eight
times more likely to have become established combustible ciga
rette smokers OR    CI  than those who
had never used ecigarettes These studies emphasize the
importance of discouraging ecigarette use in former smokers
who had successfully quit smoking and of advising never
smokers against initiating use

Finally Beard and colleagues examined how far changes in
the prevalence of ecigarette and licensed NRT use while
smoking were accompanied by changes in cigarette consumption
at the population level in active cigarette smokers This obser
vational study performed in England between  and 
showed no statistically signicant associations between changes
in ecigarette use b  e  CI e to  or
NRT use b    CI e to  and daily
cigarette consumption

Taken together although some studies have shown that
ecigarette use may lead to shortterm smoking cessation they
represent an inferior treatment approach relative to wellproven
smoking cessation strategies and their addictive potential com
bined with the lack of proven harm reduction supports caution
against their use for smoking cessation

ELECTRONIC CIGARETTE USE AND LUNG DISEASE
Whereas we have had over  years to witness lung diseases
caused by conventional tobacco we have had less than  years to
identify and classify lung diseases associated with ecigarette use In
addition we have only recently begun regularly asking patients
about and documenting ecigarette use in medical records As such
data are limited and often rely on animal studies case reports
series and cohorts describing associated lung effects and symp
tomatology Table I lists some of the reported lung health effects of
ecigarette use in both human and animal studies

Cytotoxic effects

Whereas ecigarettes have not been around long enough to
determine whether consistent use leads to common tobacco
producterelated lung diseases
such as emphysema chronic
bronchitis interstitial lung diseases or lung cancer in vitro and
in vivo studies using animal models have consistently found toxic
and procarcinogenic effects of ecigarette aerosols One of the rst
studies by Yu et al found that exposure to ecigarette aerosols led
to DNA strand breaks and cytotoxicity across cell lines Notably
this cellular and molecular damage known to drive tumorigenesis
was independent of nicotine Since that publication in 
several groups have identied further DNA damaging and DNA
repair limiting effects of ecigarettes as well as direct cyto
toxic and carcinogenic effects of ecigarettes

Cellular immunomodulation

Immune cells which are important pathologically across lung
diseases such as pneumonia interstitial lung disease asthma and

cancer have been found to be phenotypically and functionally
altered and immunomodulated by ecigarette aerosols and their
components This is particularly concerning in the setting of
infection because the diminished ability of host defense cells to
clear pathogens bacteria viral and fungal predicts that eciga
rette users may have higher rates and higher severity of infectious
diseases Through murine studies data in this area have emerged
in both airway and lung parenchymal immune cells raising
concern regarding increased susceptibility to pneumonia as well
as in circulating immune cells and those within distant organs
heart
and colon potentially increasing susceptibility to
bacteremia sepsis and multipleorgan failure in the setting of an
infectious challenge Nevertheless further studies are needed to
ensure these ndings are similarly borne out in human cells with
typical ecigarette product use

Accordingly some of the most common questions during the
COVID epidemic were whether ecigarette use increased the
risk for being infected with SARSCoV and whether vaping
increased severity and mortality Although these questions have
not yet been answered to our satisfaction in human subjects the
data are most supportive of ecigarette users having more respi
ratory symptoms even before viral infections with poten
tially increased symptoms in the setting of COVID One
national crosssectional survey of adolescents and young adults
aged  years performed in May  found that both
ecigarette users and dual ecigarette and cigarette users were
more likely to receive a diagnosis of COVID compared with
nonusers and everusers of ecigarettes were ve times more
likely to test positive OR    CI 
although the authors noted that there were likely both immu
nologic and social contributors
to positive testing among
ecigaretteusing young adults There are no convincing data that
ecigarette use leads to greater disease severity or higher mortality
in COVID However murine and in vitro data suggest
that daily ecigarette use leads to increased angiotensin convert
ing enzyme expression and is associated with more severe
acute lung injury in the setting of viral infections including a
murine coronavirus and inuenza virus Thus the current
conclusion is that ecigarette use likely leads to altered inam
matory responses in the lungs which potentially will inuence
disease severity in some viral lung infections

Data on immunophenotype changes induced in innate im
mune cells both present in the lungs at baseline and recruited
during inammatory and infectious challenges can be insightful
as to why ecigarette use may lead to altered inammatory re
sponses in the lungs Human alveolar macrophages and murine
bone marrowederived macrophages exposed to ecigarette
aerosols have decreased phagocytosis and efferocytosis Hu
man macrophages differentiated from the monocytic THP cell
line exposed to multiple common components of eliquids
nicotine propylene glycol glycerol and numerous avorants
show diminished phagocytosis of bacteria after nicotine or avor
exposure and diminished inammatory cytokine secretion after
exposure to any eliquid component including avors Neu
trophils from the circulation of ecigarette aerosols as well as
those exposed to ecigarette aerosol extracts were found to have
altered neutrophil extracellular trap formation and diminished
antimicrobial function Epithelial cells which themselves have
multiple antimicrobial and inammatory functions demonstrate
increased permeability and diminished signaling for help after e
cigarette exposure This combination of
functional and

changes

across macrophages neutrophils

and
phenotypic
epithelial cells suggests that ecigarette use affects the innate
immune system reducing functional abilities to response to in
fectious challenges

Potential for clinical disease development

Murine models are one of our only tools with which to
determine whether ecigarette use may cause disease over time
because exposure of mice to ecigarette aerosols for months is the
equivalent of years to decades in humans Broadly murine
models have demonstrated that emphysema can occur owing to
ecigarettes but it may be a factor of both genetics and expo
sure and that pulmonary brosis may be promoted by using
ecigarettes In addition multiple groups have shown dimin
ished host responses to infectious challenges in the setting of
inhalation bacterial and viral and
ecigarette aerosol
increased pathogen virulence bacterial and fungal One of
the most shocking studies of  was the article by Tang et al
which demonstrated an increase in lung adenocarcinoma
tumorigenesis in the setting of a year of daily ecigarette aerosol
exposure depending on the presence of nicotine within the
aerosols Finally ecigarette exposure daily for months has been
shown to cause disease beyond the lung including cardiac renal
and hepatic brosis neuroinammation in the central nervous
system and altered inammatory states
in the heart and
colon

Although much is still unknown there are multiple reports
identifying ecigarette use as the cause of a variety of more acute
and subacute lung diseases including eosinophilic pneumonia
hypersensitivity pneumonitis bronchiolitis organizing
pneumonia alveolar hemorrhage and acute respiratory
distress syndrome In many of these cases patients became
critically ill before clinicians could recognize or identify the
inhalant use as a potential driver Thus these few cases that were
identied as related to ecigarettes suggest that many more may
be occurring across the world but are not being identied as
related to vaping

The ecigarette or vaping product useassociated
lung injury epidemic

In  a lung disease specic to vaping of tetrahydrocan
nabinol THC was identied ecigarette or vaping product use
associated lung injury Many of the affected patients were
teenagers or young adults and some required our highest level of
support extracorporeal membrane oxygenation Whereas
the ecigarette or vaping product useassociated lung injury
epidemic is a disease of THC vapers cases have continued to be
identied into  this epidemic brought to light the dangers
of inhaling chemicals that have never been assessed for potential
pulmonary and wholebody toxicity It took over  deaths and
thousands of vapers falling ill before vitamin E acetate was
identied as the causal agent which was being added to THC
containing eliquids by retailers Of note vitamin E does not
sound dangerous and liquid formulations are widely available in
stores and online Many people ingest it or apply it topically
because it is generally considered safe for consumer use Thus it
came as a surprise to many to nd that it was highly toxic to lung
cells when inhaled Because there has been no regulation of what
chemicals can and cannot be added to nicotine or THC eliq
uids it may be only a matter of time until the next lung injury
epidemic owing to vaping devices occurs

healthier and safer than conventional tobacco and because of the
less averse smell and look of ecigarette aerosols compared with

ecigarettes began vaping in their homes and cars in the presence
of their children This has led to high secondhand ecigarette
aerosol exposures in those who live with ecigarette users
However we now have data demonstrating that lung diseases

ELECTRONIC CIAGARETTE USE AMONG
ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS

The past decade has seen a sharp rise in the use of ecigarettes
and vaping devices globally among youth and young adults
Ecigarettes have become rmly established as the most commonly
used tobacco product among youth in the United States since
 In  nearly one in ve high school students
 reported currently using ecigarettes The ongoing
adoption of ecigarettes among Americas youth has garnered
signicant recent attention from public health advocates because
their uptake has dampened efforts to combat tobacco product use
among adolescents Ecigarette popularity is to blame for the
concerning plateau in the use of tobacco products among high
school students More than one in four high school students
 continue to report current use of tobacco products

Potential
tobacco product use

for

relative harm reduction in youth

Some authors have proposed that this shift to using eciga
rettes among youths is a positive trend arguing that this may
represent a relative reduction in harm compared with the sig
nicant short and longterm risks of traditional tobacco smok
ing For example in their crosssectional matched control study
Shahab et al used behavioral controls and propensity score
matching within data between the  and  National
Youth Tobacco Surveys to compare cigarette smoking rates of
adolescents who rst tried ecigarettes compared with those who
rst tried cigarettes or more traditional tobacco products They
found that compared with adolescents who had tried a traditional
cigarette as their rst tobacco initiation product adolescents who
had used an ecigarette rst were less likely to be both past
day cigarette smokers OR    CI  and
established cigarette smokers OR    CI 
This suggests that youths who try ecigarettes as their rst to
bacco product may be less likely to transition to traditional to
bacco products in the future relative to those whose rst tobacco

product is conventional tobacco less than  of young eciga
rette users in that study became established traditional cigarette
smokers Similarly using data from the rst three annual waves
of the nationally representative sample of baseline tobacconaive
youths enrolled in the PATH study Xu et al found that the
risk for past day combustible cigarette use was comparatively
sevenfold lower when youths
started with an ecigarette
compared with a combustible cigarette One hypothesis as to
why using ecigarettes rst may lead to these youths and young
adults sticking with ecigarettes alone comes from Jankowski
et al who found that nicotine dependence was two times
greater in young mean age  years ecigarette users versus
conventional cigarette smokers mean age  vs  years P
  However unlike in the study by Shahab et al Xu et al
importantly noted that among tobacconaive youth in the PATH
study the initiation of ecigarette use was associated with greater
risk for subsequent initiation of combustible cigarette smoking
OR    CI  as well as past day
combustible cigarette use OR    CI 
However this risk was higher when youths started with a
combustible cigarette

Transition to traditional cigarette use

Unfortunately numerous other prospective

longitudinal
studies have demonstrated the strong association between the
onset of youths ecigarette use and subsequent traditional ciga
rette smoking For example in their longitudinal survey of
high school students in southern California Leventhal et al
found that even when adjusted for various sociodemographic
environmental and intrapersonal factors including risk behav
iors baseline ecigarette use was associated with a signicant
increase in the odds of traditional cigarette smoking in the similar
range of  to  OR depending on the outcome
Furthermore in a metaanalysis of nine USbased studies Soneji
et al reported a concordant pooled OR for subsequent tradi
tional cigarette smoking of   CI  for ever
versus never ecigarette users after adjusting for known de
mographic psychosocial and behavioral risk factors for tradi
tional cigarette smoking with an even higher relative OR of 
 CI  among youths who reported ecigarette use
in the past  days

One recently published study comparatively evaluating data
from the more recent PATH study waves  to  years 
 and  to  years  shows that whereas this
strong association between ever ecigarette use and subsequent
transition to combustible cigarette smoking held in waves  to 
an attenuation of the signicance of this transition occurs in
waves  to  adjusted OR aOR    CI 
and in waves  to  aOR    CI 
despite the relatively high ongoing use of ecigarettes as the
current tobacco product of choice among youths in the United
States One theory for this is that newergeneration ecigarettes
and ENDS for vaping are more efcient at nicotine delivery and
may be supplanting the need for traditional combustible cigarette
use to obtain a greater high once dependence has occurred
Historically traditional combustible cigarettes have allowed for
the fastest and most efcient delivery of nicotine among the array
of available tobacco products reinforcing their status as

some of the most addictive products sold on commercial mar
kets However the more recent advent of customizable Pod Mod
devices coupled with innovations in nicotine chemistry allow for
the use of less caustic protonated nicotine formulations derived
from the nicotine salts in looseleaf tobacco as well as perhaps
even more appealing completely synthetic nicotine salts Thus
newergeneration ecigarettes and ENDS are now able to deliver
much higher nicotine concentrations than combustible cigarettes
without the traditional acerbic taste and inhalational effects

These devices have additional appeal among youths because
they often have sleek easily concealed designs resembling pens or
USB devices or are even made to resemble smartphones gaming

newergeneration saltbased nicotine eliquids are available in a
host of attractive fruity minty and candybased avors that hold
appeal for youthful users which can further mask subjective
caustic initial effects of higherdose nicotine inhalation

continuation aOR    CI  and a higher
level of nicotinecontaining puffs taken on each vaping event

unavored tobacco or menthol avors among youths who use
ecigarettes Data from the most recent  NYTS revealed
that among youths currently using ecigarettes
the most
commonly used device type was disposables Both high school
and middle school students reported that their usual brand of
choice was Puff Bar Puff Bar Wilmington DE  and
 respectively a nicotinic saltebased product with a
vors such as Guava Ice and Strawberry Banana In fact likely
owing to this combination of reduced acridity potentially higher
nicotine content and widely available range of avors all of the
most recently reported top brands of choice favored among
youths currently using ecigarettes including Puff Bar VUSE
RJ Reynolds Vapor Company WinstonSalem NC SMOK
Shenzhen IVPS Technology CO Shenzhen China and
JUUL Altria Group Richmond VA offer nicotine
saltebased products as topselling products with increasing gains
in sales market share

The use of these newer rapidly absorbed saltbased nicotine
products and subsequent regular highlevel exposure to nicotine
among youths creates additional concern for public health of
cials because it is wellknown that the developing adolescent
brain is particularly susceptible to the effects of nicotine which
has been shown to inuence longterm molecular biochemical
and functional changes that increase the risk for future subse
quent addictive behaviors risk taking and substance depen
dence Moreover numerous studies have demonstrated
the association between ecigarette use among youths and other
risktaking behaviors including the use of alcohol and progression

cannabis Furthermore youths exposure to nicotine via
ecigarettes is associated with increased risk for mood attention
and sleep disorders Perhaps most concerningly
Kim et al found that after adjusting for a variety of socio
economic demographics risktaking behaviors and reported
stress levels both male and female adolescents who used ecig
arettes had signicantly higher rates of suicidal ideation suicide

combustible cigarette users or neversmokers The authors cited

Taken together it is unsurprising that the evolving body of
literature on the use of ecigarettes among youths has caused a
signicant amount of consternation among those concerned with
the health and wellbeing of adolescents and young adults Calls
have arisen for stronger regulatory actions in the ecigarette and
ENDS device markets In recent years these
calls have led to efforts at the federal level by the FDA to limit
the sales of ecigarettes to Americas youth by increasing the
federal minimum legal
tobacco products
including ecigarettes from  to  years across the United
States The FDA also put forth a prioritized effort to
regulate avored prelled cartridgebased ecigarettes as of
 Perhaps owing to these efforts data from the Na
tional Youth Tobacco Surveys demonstrated that current use of
ecigarettes declined for the rst time in recent years between
 and  among both high school  to  and
middle school students  to 

sales age for all

However loopholes still exist in the ongoing development of
avored products and persistent pervasive marketing targeted at
underaged ecigarette users Approximately  of US middle
and high school students reported ongoing exposure to eciga
rette advertisements from both physical retail stores and Internet
based sources in  Furthermore a recent survey among
youths and young adults in California revealed that despite being
under the legal age of  required for vaping device purchases in
that state most users  reported being able to purchase
their own devices both in person at vape shops and from online
retailers Ongoing federal state and local efforts to prevent and
reduce youth tobacco product use including the use of eciga
rettes will be imperative as the landscape of youth ecigarette
exposure continues to evolve

CONCLUSION

Although ecigarettes are a relatively new addition to the to
bacco product market their recent uptake among consumers
particularly among youths and young adults warrants signicant
attention given the potential implications for both individual
level and populationbased health outcomes Currently
the
negative effects of ecigarette use seem to outweigh any potential
benet because the available evidence does not conrm the use
