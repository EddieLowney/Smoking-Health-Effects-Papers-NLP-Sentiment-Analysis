Cigarette smoking is the most important cause of premature death and it is currently
listed as a major independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease Because of
restrictive measures and widespread control policies tobacco companies are now
using aggressive marketing strategies in favor of smokeless tobacco including elec
tronic nicotine delivery systems which are also known as electronic cigarettes or e
cigarettes Although the regular use of these devices appears less hazardous than
traditional cigarettes or other forms of smokeless tobacco recent studies have shown
that various potentially harmful substances especially nicotine ultraparticles and
volatile organic compounds may be effectively inhaled or liberated in exhaled air during
repeated ecigarette pufng This would enhance the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and
hypertension which may predispose some users to increased risk of cardiovascular
events which may be further magnied by other potential adverse effects such as
arrhythmias increased respiratory and ow respiratory resistance Some cases of
intoxication have also been described wherein large amounts of nicotine and other
harmful compounds may be effectively absorbed As the use of ecigarettes is
continuously rising and it is also considered a potentially effective method for smoking
cessation more focused research is urgently needed to denitely establish the
cardiovascular safeness of these devices

The Cigarette Smoke Epidemics

According to the latest available updates released by the
American Heart Association AHA  of men and 
of women aged  years or older are current cigarette
smokers in the United States Although the percentage of
current cigarette smokers ie  overall has declined by
nearly onefth since  when the rate was 

tobacco smoking causes nearly  of overall deaths in
the United States with approximately onethird of these
attributable to cardiovascular disease Even more impressive
is that approximately  of cigarette smokingrelated
deaths are reportedly caused by secondhand so called
passive smoke The direct medical costs and lost productivity
costs associated with smoking are estimated at approximate
ly  and  billion thus totaling an estimated  billion

per year Cigarette smoking either in active or passive form
is therefore considered the most important preventable cause
of premature death in the United States as well as in most
industrialized and developing countries and is currently
listed as a major independent risk factor for cardiovascular
disease Cigarette smoke contains thousands of chemicals
such as nicotine carbon monoxide CO tar and several
carcinogens among many others which contribute to a
kaleidoscope of negative effects on human biology including
hypertension decreased exercise tolerance progression of
atherosclerotic lesions and procoagulant effects

Smokeless Tobacco

Smokeless tobacco is a vague term that refers to several
tobacco products used by means other than smoking and
includes snuff loose tobacco particles or sachets chewing
loose leaf plug and twist formulations spit tobacco oral
compresses and dry powders eg moist nass snus gutkha
or gul tobacco These products usually contain several addi
tives some of which are added for avor eg nuts vanilla
sugar spices and oils and others to enhance pH eg
ammonium and sodium carbonate and thus increase the
concentration of unprotonated nicotine The nicotine and
other compounds contained in formulations are typically
absorbed across the buccal mucosa whereas dry ne powder
formulations of snuff can also be sniffed into the nose
Because of the different manufacturing techniques products
may vary broadly in chemical composition and relative nico
tine content eg approximately  mgg of product in
chewing tobacco approximately  mgg of product in dry
snuff tobacco approximately  mgg of product in moist
snuff tobacco as compared with  to  mgg of product in
traditional cigarettes Although the absorption of combus
tionderived carcinogenic substances such as benzoapyrene
and other polycyclic compounds is expectedly lower other
carcinogens such as nitrosamines have instead a relatively
high concentration in smokeless tobacco products

The Electronic Cigarette

Because of the restrictive measures and widespread control
policies particularly in developed countries tobacco compa
nies are now using aggressive marketing policies in favor of
smokeless tobacco for recovery from economical loss due to
reduced income from traditional cigarette smoke Along with
more traditional and prevalent forms of smokeless tobacco
electronic nicotine delivery systemsalso known as elec
tronic cigarettes or ecigaretteswere rst commercial
ized in China nearly  years ago and their market rapidly
grew and spread rst through sales via the Web and more
recently in tobacco shops and retail outlets Basically an e
cigarette is a device that looks and should feel like a real
cigarette but which does not burn tobacco Within a tube
containing a mouthpiece and a socket for cartridge insertion
a conventional ecigarette also houses a battery a heating
element a power source and a pressure switch The cartridge
which is device specic typically contains  to  mg of

nicotine Fig  The rell kit which may contain up to  g
of nicotine in a small bottle is used to ll the cartridge with
replacement solution at higher doses than originally con
tained With notable differences among different brands and
types these devices also contain various amounts of humec
tants such as propylene glycol or glycerol to produce the
vapor avors eg mint vanilla fruit and chocolate and
even drugs such as rimonabant ie a substance typically used
for weight loss and amino tadalal ie a drug analog of the
commercially approved tadalal which is used to treat
erectile dysfunction

With regard to the concordance between the content of
ecigarette rell bottles and what is stated on the label Etter
et al purchased and assessed  bottles of  different brands 
were obtained from Web sites and shipped by regular mail by
retailers and the remainder was obtained directly from the
manufacturer The analysis based on ultrahigh performance
liquid chromatography and gas chromatography was aimed to
quantify nicotine content known nicotine degradation products
and potential impurities The relative nicotine content of each
bottle was rather similar to that claimed by the manufacturer
and reported in the label with a mean percentage concordance
of   condence interval CI  and a range
between  and  The remarkable concentration of nico
tinerelated impurities found in the bottles between  and 
of nicotine concentration although most samples exhibited
values between  and  of nicotine content suggests however
that oxidative degradation of the basic compound may have
occurred during manufacturing of ingredients or nal liquid or
that nondesirable interactions with the packaging material may
have occurred along with inadequate handling and storage of
bottles Neither ethylene glycol nor diethylene glycol could be
detected in uids which suggests that the overall quality of e
liquids may be somehow reassuring Cameron et al analyzed
nicotine solutions contained in seven different ecigarettes by
liquid chromatographyelectrospray ionization tandem mass
spectrometry and found that the concentration of nicotine
was equivalent toor lower thanthat marked or expected
given the manufacturer concentration ranges provided ie

between  and  Nevertheless the absolute level ie from
 to  mgmL was sufcient to be toxic or lethal should
the product be orally ingested or transdermally absorbed and
considering that the fatal dose of nicotine is  to  mg in
adults and  mg in children In another recent study Kim
and Shin used liquid chromatographytandem mass spectro
metric to detect and measure tobaccospecic nitrosamines
which are wellestablished carcinogenic substancesin 
replacement liquids of ecigarettes produced by  compa
nies The overall rate of detection of one or more of these
harmful compounds was  varying between  and 
according to the different specic substance with a maximum
concentration of  gL which was up to  times higher
than that declared by manufacturers In line with this nding
Williams et al found signicant amounts of metal and silicate
particles in cartomizer aerosol which further supports the
need for improved quality control in ecigarette design and
manufacture

The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ecigarettes
have been investigated in some studies Bullen et al earlier
reported that the use of a mg electronic nicotine delivery
device increased serum nicotine to a peak of  ngmL within
 minutes as compared with  ngmL in  minutes
using a traditional tobacco cigarette Vansickel et al also
assessed plasma nicotine and carbon CO concentration in 
subjects who took  puffs of  mg or  mg electronic nicotine
delivery devices compared with a traditional tobacco cigarette
The mean plasma nicotine increased from a preadministration
level of  ngmL to a peak of  ngmL  minutes after the use
of traditional cigarette whereas no signicant changes could be
observed for either ecigarette device Similarly the mean CO
increased from a preadministration level of  parts per million
ppm to a peak of  ppm  minutes after use of traditional
cigarette but again no signicant changes could be found for
both ecigarettes Passive vaping vaporizing has also been
reported from consumption of ecigarettes Schripp et al ana
lyzed the release of volatile organic compounds and ultrane
particles from an ecigarette under neartorealuse condi
tions and found a high amount of propanediol along
with moderate levels of propanetriol diacetin nicotine
and ultrane particles in exhaled air Ingebrethsen et al also
found that undiluted ecigarette aerosols have particle diameters
averaging between  and  nm with approximate concen
tration of  particlescm range which are gures globally
comparable to those found in tobacco burning cigarette smoke
Finally Goniewicz et al recently assessed nicotine levels in vapor
generated from  ecigarettes differing for brands and mod
els The mean nicotine amount in original unused cartridges
was  mg  CI  mg that contained in rell
solutions was  mg  CI  mg and that released
to vapor with  puffs was  mg  CI  mg Overall
the effective vaporization of nicotine ranged from  to  of
the relative amounts present in cartridges By assuming that 
puffs of ecigarette may be more or less equivalent to smoking
one tobacco cigarette the overall amount of nicotine inhaled
with an electronic cigarette would hence range between 
and  mg This is a lower amount than that absorbed by
smoking a traditional tobacco cigarette ie between  and

 mg but still represents a meaningful quantity that can be
notably increased by enhancing puff strength or using higher
amounts of rells Taken together these data provide clear
evidence that a variety of harmful substancesespecially
nicotine ultraparticles and volatile organic compoundsmay
be effectively inhaled or liberated in the exhaled air during
repeated ecigarette pufng Fig 

ECigarette and Cardiovascular Disease

The use of these devices for management of tobacco depen
dence is controversial due to a paucity of longterm safety
results and randomized controlled data The typical prole of
an ecigarette user has been investigated by Dawkins et al in
an online survey The vast majority of participants up to
 reported not smoking for at least a few weeks as using
the ecigarette whereas  of them reported a reduced urge
to smoke Approximately  of the participants were using a
tank system most commonly the eGoC Shenzhen
Joyetech Co Ltd ShenZhen China The mean period of use
was  months A very low number of participants ie 
reported exclusive use of nonnicotinecontaining liquid
Indeed the awareness and current use of these devices
steadily grows In Great Britain for example the current
use of ecigarettes among the overall general population
has more than doubled between  and  ie from
 to 

Although it is usually considered less harmful than ciga
rette smoking for both cancer and cardiovascular disease
there is increasing evidence supporting the notion that
smokeless tobacco may be less safe than conventionally
supposed The largest epidemiological study regarding the
potential inuence of smokeless tobacco on cardiovascular
risk was published in  In this large prospective trial the
incidence of cardiovascular disease was assessed in 
participants of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities
ARIC Study aged  to  years at baseline Smokeless
tobacco use was herein dened as current and past use of
chewing tobacco and snuff During a median followup of
 years  cardiovascular events ie acute coronary
syndrome or stroke were recorded The current use of
smokeless tobacco at baseline conferred a fold  CI
 greater risk of cardiovascular events than the
nonuse even after adjustment for several demographic
socioeconomic lifestyle and tobaccorelated variables Even

more interestingly although the risk of cardiovascular events
was higher in smokers of traditional cigarettes ie  
CI  the cardiovascular rate associated with current
use of smokeless tobacco was more than  higher than that
for current cigarette smoking ie  vs  per
sonyears and this has been attributed to an acute response to
the over  various chemical compounds contained in
smokeless tobacco In the earlier metaanalysis of Boffetta
and Straif the relative risk for ever use of smokeless tobacco
products was   CI  for myocardial infarction
and   CI  for stroke respectively A recent
Policy Statement by the AHA concluded that data from the
majority of available studies do not support an increased
incidence of hypertension or nonfatal and fatal myocardial
infarction in users of smokeless tobacco although data
published by Yatsuya and Folsom and the outcome of the
metaanalysis by Boffetta and Straif raise serious doubts
about this conclusion

So although available data show that smokeless tobacco
may carry a tangible cardiovascular risk for current users these
ndings cannot be automatically translated to ecigarettes
because of their peculiar manufacturing and composition
Unfortunately the relatively recent commercialization has
not permitted performance of large prospective studies and
attainment of any reliable estimate of the potential cardiovas
cular risk of these devices Nevertheless some preliminary
publications and case reports should raise widespread alert
ness regarding the cardiovascular safety of these devices

Vardavas et al investigated whether the use of an electronic
cigarette for  minutes would produce a signicant effect on
pulmonary function and fraction of exhaled nitric oxide in 
healthy adult smokers and reported an immediate decrease
in fraction of exhaled nitric oxide along with enhanced total
respiratory and ow respiratory resistances These ndings led
the authors to conclude that the negative biological effects of
shortterm use of ecigarettes may be similar to those observed
with conventional tobacco smoking Comparable ndings
were reported by Gennimata et al who assessed spirometry
static lung volumes airway resistance airway conductance
and a single breath nitrogen test in  consecutive subjects 
of whom never smoked and  of whom were instead smokers
 with normal spirometry and  with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease and asthma immediately after smoking an
ecigarette for  minutes A statistically signicant increase
was observed in airway resistance combined with a signicant
decrease of airway conductance especially in smokers and
nonsmokers but not in patients with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease and asthma These results led the authors
to conclude that the sudden increase in airway resistance may
cause immediate harm after using the device especially in
selected categories of patients such as those suffering from
coronary artery disease In a further study Farsalinos et al
assessed cardiac function in  healthy young daily smokers
aged  to  years before and after smoking  tobacco
cigarette and  daily electronic cigarette users of similar
age before and after using an ecigarette with nicotine concen
tration of  mgmL for  minutes The use of the ecigarette
did not cause signicant alterations in any echocardiographic

parameters except for a modest increase of MVA wave
whereas smokers of a tobacco cigarette exhibited a variety of
signicant abnormalities This led the authors to conclude that
an ecigarette does not trigger acute adverse effects on cardiac
function

Although the ecigarette may therefore be safer than
traditional tobacco smoke and even other types of smokeless
tobacco when used under ideal conditions adverse effects
together with occasional cases of poisoning by device rells
have been described
In an interesting study Hua et al
collected shortterm health effects produced by ecigarette
use through an analysis of original posts from three online
ecigarettes forums Overall  different effects were
identied  of which  were negative the remaining
were characterized as positive The respiratory system was
more frequently affected  cases followed by mouth and
throat n   the neurological system n   the senso
rial system n   the digestive tract n   the muscu
larskeletal n   and cardiocirculatory systems  chest
symptoms  circulatory The more frequent cardiovascular
complaints included chest pain or pressure arrhythmias
and abnormal blood pressure namely hypertension More
specically blood pressure changes were reported by nearly
 of users wherein hypertension was the most frequent sign
that was diagnosed by physicians

Vansickel and Eissenberg assessed plasma nicotine con
centration heart rate and subjective ratings of nicotine
product effects in eight ecigarette users at baseline after
 puffs with a second interpuff interval after  hour after
ad libitum pufng and hour afterward Compared with
baseline the concentration of plasma nicotine increased
signicantly within  minutes after the rst puff up to 
ngmL and persisted as increased throughout the ad libitum
pufng period from over  ngmL Similarly the heart
rate increase from  cid  to  cid  beats per minute
bpm  minutes after the rst puff and persisted elevated
throughout the following period At variance with previous
data showing minimal or no nicotine delivery by ecigarette
this study has a much higher practical signicance as the
ecigarette users not only were allowed to provide their
preferred device and avornicotine concentration but they
were also allowed to follow their typical pattern of consump
tion during the hour ad libitum pufng period Thus
effective nicotine delivery had occurred under this more
realworld situation A nicotinergic impact has also been
documented by Flouris et al who reported that the effect on
serum levels of cotinine a metabolite of nicotine after active
and passive ecigarette smoking does not differ from that
generated by a conventional tobacco cigarette

As mentioned some case reports have been published about
the potential cardiovascular adverse effects of ecigarettes
mostly attributable to improper use Monroy et al described
the case of a yearold white woman with a medical history
of hypertension hyperlipidemia osteoarthritis and allergic
rhinitis who developed paroxysmal atrial brillation tempo
rally associated with ecigarette use As accurate investiga
tions failed to show additional triggers an improper use of a
fullstrength nicotine replacement device was identied as the

most probable source of arrhythmias In fact the rell bottle
had never lasted as long as expected by the patient a fact that
was highly suggestive for incorrect ie excessive rell of e
cigarette cartridge thus exposing her to a very high dose of
nicotine which is otherwise associated with a wellestablished
proarrhythmic effect When the patient ceased to use the e
cigarette no further episodes of paroxysmal atrial brillation
were reported We have also recently described the case of
nicotine poisoning in a yearold girl who reported to have
mixed the content of an electronic cigarette rell with  mL of
methadone improperly bottled in a generic vial The spec
trum of symptoms observed in the patient included tachycardia
 bpm and sinus tachycardia at the electrocardiograph
hypertension  mm Hg ushing salivation and nau
sea Although the young girl had a favorable outcome the
small volume of the rell contents used highlight the serious
risk of easy ingestion or injection of harmfulpotentially lethal
doses of nicotine thus posing a substantial threat over
widespread and under regulated marketing of these devices
and their rells eg a typical  mL bottle rell solution may
contain up to  mgmL nicotine which approximately corre
sponds to  mg of nicotine

Conclusions

Strongly propelled by easy availability through the Web the
worldwide market of ecigarettes continues to grow despite
limited information on their safety adverse effects and even
efcacy for smoking cessation Although ecigarettes are
expected to generate andor release fewer dangerous sub
stances than conventional tobacco cigarettes and current
evidence provides limited support for a comparative lessened
increased cardiovascular risk in current users there are some
important issues that should be emphasized about the cur
rently claimed safety of these devices

Thus although the use of ecigarette appears more favor
able than traditional cigarettes or smokeless tobacco prod
ucts recent data conversely attests that the more typical
patterns of use may be associated with signicant release of
nicotine thus producing a plasma nicotine concentration
which may ultimately approximate that of traditional ciga
rette smoking because the minute nicotine particles con
tained in the vapor allow fast and effective delivery into the
bloodstream This would explain the enhanced risk of cardiac
arrhythmias and hypertension which may predispose some
usersespecially those with coronary atherosclerosis or
other known cardiovascular risk factorsto a substantial
risk of acute coronary syndrome which may be further
magnied by other potential adverse effects ie arrhyth
mias increased respiratory and ow respiratory resistance
Fig  Some cases of intoxication wherein an amount of
nicotine and other harmful compounds may be absorbed at a
much larger extent than with traditional cigarettes have also
been reported According to this data ecigarettes have been
classied as drug delivery devices in several countries and
their marketing has been temporarily limited or even sus
pended until safety prole and efcacy will be nally estab
lished in clinical trials The US Food and Drug Administration

Seminars in Thrombosis  Hemostasis

Fig  Potentially harmful effects of electronic cigarettes on human
biology

has also publicly discouraged the use of these devices in
July  raising serious concerns that ecigarettes may be
marketed to young people and lack appropriate health
warnings

Basically their large and easy availability on the Web a
phenomenon that has several points in common with the
black market of doping substances combined with the
existence of a clear doseresponse relationship effect on
cardiovascular risk suggests that major caution regarding
the use of these devices should be used especially in persons
at increased risk of developing cardiovascular events The
effects on blood pressure and heart rate are particularly
concerning as hypertension is a wellestablished cardiovas
cular risk factor whereas heart rate is a signicant predictor
of mortality in patients with known cardiovascular disease
It is also noteworthy that ecigarettes require stronger vacu
ums suction than conventional tobacco cigarette and this
effect remains unclear on enhanced absorption of dangerous
substances and human health As the use of ecigarettes is
continuously rising and it may be a potentially effective
approach for smoking cessation more focused research is
urgently needed to denitely establish the cardiovascular
safety of these devices Should ecigarettes be less harmful
than traditional tobacco smoking or smokeless tobacco then
this would represent a favorable alternative for tobacco
addictions but may conversely pose serious threat on more
fragile members of the society such as children and teens
who may be persuaded to start using electronic cigarette with
unproven assumption of safety become addicted to nicotine
and eventually begin to smoke tobacco cigarettes or worse
abuse the level of active compounds in rell bottles with
potential catastrophic outcome
