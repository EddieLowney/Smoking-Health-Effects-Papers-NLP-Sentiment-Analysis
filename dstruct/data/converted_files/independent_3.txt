Abstract Cigarettesmokingisthemostimportantcauseofprematuredeath,anditiscurrently
listed as a major independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Because of
restrictive measures and widespread control policies, tobacco companies are now
using aggressive marketing strategies in favor of smokeless tobacco, including elec-
tronic nicotine delivery systems, which are also known as electronic cigarettes or e-
cigarettes. Although the regular use of these devices appears less hazardous than
traditionalcigarettesorother formsofsmokelesstobacco,recentstudieshaveshown
that various potentially harmful substances, especially nicotine, ultraparticles, and
volatileorganiccompounds,maybeeffectivelyinhaledorliberatedinexhaledairduring
repeated e-cigarette puffing. This would enhance the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and
hypertension, which may predispose some users to increased risk of cardiovascular
events, which may be further magnified by other potential adverse effects such as
Keywords arrhythmias, increased respiratory, and flow respiratory resistance. Some cases of
