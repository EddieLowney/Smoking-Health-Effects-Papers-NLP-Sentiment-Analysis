Safety evaluation and risk assessment of 
electronic cigarettes as tobacco cigarette 
substitutes a systematic review

Konstantinos E Farsalinos and Riccardo Polosa

Abstract  Electronic cigarettes are a recent development in tobacco harm reduction They 
are marketed as less harmful alternatives to smoking Awareness and use of these devices 
has grown exponentially in recent years with millions of people currently using them This 
systematic review appraises existing laboratory and clinical research on the potential risks 
from electronic cigarette use compared with the wellestablished devastating effects of 
smoking tobacco cigarettes Currently available evidence indicates that electronic cigarettes 
are by far a less harmful alternative to smoking and significant health benefits are expected in 
smokers who switch from tobacco to electronic cigarettes Research will help make electronic 
cigarettes more effective as smoking substitutes and will better define and further reduce 
residual risks from use to as low as possible by establishing appropriate quality control and 
standards

Introduction
Complete tobacco cessation is the best outcome 
for  smokers  However  the  powerful  addictive  
properties of nicotine and the ritualistic behavior 
of  smoking  create  a  huge  hurdle  even  for  those 
with a strong desire to quit Until recently smok
ers were left with just two alternatives either quit 
or suffer the harmful consequences of continued 
smoking This  gloomy  scenario  has  allowed  the 
smoking pandemic to escalate with nearly  mil
lion deaths annually and a predicted death toll of 
  billion  within  the  st  century  World  Health 
Organization  But a third choice involving 
the use of alternative and much safer sources of 
nicotine with the goal to reduce smokingrelated 
diseases is now available tobacco harm reduction 
THR Rodu and Godshall 

Electronic  cigarettes  ECs  are  the  newest  and 
most  promising  products  for THR  Polosa  et  al 
b They are electricallydriven devices con
sisting of the battery part usually a lithium bat
tery and an atomizer where liquid is stored and 
is aerosolized by applying energy and generating 
heat to a resistance encircling a wick The liquid 
used mainly consists of propylene glycol glycerol 

distilled water flavorings that may or may not be 
approved for food use and nicotine Consumers 
commonly called vapers may choose from sev
eral  nicotine  strengths  including  nonnicotine 
liquids and a countless list of flavors this assort
ment is a characteristic feature that distinguishes 
ECs  from  any  other THR  products  Since  their 
invention in  there has been constant inno
vation  and  development  of  more  efficient  and 
appealing  products  Currently  there  are  mainly 
three types of devices available Dawkins  
depicted in Figure   Firstgeneration devices 
generally mimicking the size and look of regular 
cigarettes and consisting of small lithium batteries 
and cartomizers ie cartridges which are usually 
prefilled  with  a  liquid  that  bathes  the  atomizer 
Batteries  may  be  disposable  to  be  used  once 
only  or  rechargeable    Secondgeneration 
devices consisting mainly of highercapacity lith
ium  batteries  and  atomizers  with  the  ability  to 
refill  them  with  liquid  sold  in  separate  bottles 
In  the  most  recent  atomizers  you  can  simply 
change  the  atomizer  head  resistance  and  wick 
while  keeping  the  body  of  the  atomizer  thus 
reducing the operating costs  Thirdgeneration 
devices also called Mods from modifications

consisting of very largecapacity lithium batteries 
with  integrated  circuits  that  allow  vapers  to 
change  the  voltage  or  power  wattage  delivered 
to the atomizer These devices can be combined 
with  either  secondgeneration  atomizers  or  with 
rebuildable atomizers where the consumers have 
the ability to prepare their own setup of resistance 
and wick

Awareness and use vaping of ECs has increased 
exponentially in recent years Data obtained from 
the HealthStyles survey showed that in the US 
awareness  of  ECs  rose  from    from 
 to  with EC use rising from  
over the same time period King et al  In 
the United Kingdom EC use in regular smokers 
increased  from    in    to    in   
Dockrell  et  al    Similar  findings  were 
obtained from the International Tobacco Control 
FourCountry  Survey  Adkison  et  al    A 
recent  prospective  study  in  Swiss  army  recruits 
showed that  of smokers who tried ECs pro
gressed to daily use Douptcheva et al  It 
must  be  noted  that  this  increase  in  EC  use  has 
occurred  despite  the  concerns  raised  by  public 
health authorities about the safety and appropri
ateness of using these products as alternatives to 
smoking  National  Association  of  Attorneys

The popularity of ECs may be due to their ability 
to deal both with the physical ie nicotine and 
the behavioral component of smoking addiction 
In  particular  sensory  stimulation  Rose  and 
Levin  and simulation of smoking behavior 
and  cigarette  manipulation  Hajek  et  al   
are important determinants of a products effec
tiveness  in  reducing  or  completely  substituting 
smoking These  features  are  generally  absent  in 
nicotine replacement therapies NRTs and oral 

medications  for  nicotine  dependence  whereas 
ECs are unique in that they provide rituals asso
ciated  with  smoking  behavior  eg  handto
mouth  movement  visible  smoke  exhaled  and 
sensory stimulation associated with it Farsalinos 
et  al  b This  explains  why  these  products 
can  be  effective  in  reducing  consumption  of 
tobacco smoking Bullen et al  Caponnetto 
et al b Polosa et al  and are efficient 
as  longterm  substitutes  of  conventional  ciga
rettes Farsalinos et al b

Methods
For this systematic review Figure  we searched 
the  PubMed  electronic  database  by  using  key
words  related  to  ECs  andor  their  combination 
ecigarette  electronic  cigarette  electronic  nico
tine delivery systems We obtained a total of  
results and selected  studies we judged relevant 
to  research  on  EC  safetyrisk  profile  Reference 
lists  from  these  studies  were  also  examined  to 
identify  relevant  articles We  searched  additional 
information  in  abstracts  presented  at  scientific 
congresses  respiratory  cardiovascular  tobacco 
control  toxicology  and  in  reports  of  chemical 
analyses on EC samples that were available online 
We also looked for selected studies on chemicals 
related  to  EC  ingredients  eg  nicotine  propyl
ene glycol glycerol cinnamaldehyde microparti
cles emission etc but not specifically evaluated 
in  EC  research  In  total    publications  were 
found from which  chemical analyses of single 
or a limited number of EC samples were excluded 
because  they  were  discussed  in  a  review  paper 
Cahn and Siegel  In total  studies are 
cited in this paper 

Risk differences compared with 
conventional cigarettes and the issue of 
nicotine
Conventional  cigarettes  are  the  most  common 
form of nicotine intake Smokingrelated diseases 
are  pathophysiologically  attributed  to  oxidative 
stress  activation  of  inflammatory  pathways  and 
the toxic effect of more than  chemicals and 
carcinogens 
smoke 
Environmental  Protection  Agency    In 
addition each puff contains    free radi
cals Pryor and Stone  All of these chemi
cals  are  emitted  mostly  during  the  combustion 
process  which  is  absent  in  ECs  Although  the 
addictive  potential  of  nicotine  and  related  com
pounds  is  largely  documented  Guillem  et  al

 much less dissemination has been given to 
the  notion  that  nicotine  does  not  contribute  to 
smokingrelated diseases It is not classified as a 
carcinogen  by  the  International  Agency  for 
Research  on  Cancer  WHOIARC    and 
does  not  promote  obstructive  lung  disease  A 
major misconception commonly supported even 
by  physicians  is  that  nicotine  promotes  cardio
vascular disease However it has been established 
that nicotine itself has minimal effect in initiating 
and  promoting  atherosclerotic  heart  disease

lipid profile Ludviksdottir et al  An obser
vational  study  of  more  than    smokers 
found no evidence of increased risk for myocar
dial  infarction  or  acute  stroke  after  NRT  sub
scription  although  follow  up  was  only    days 
Hubbard et al  Up to  years of nicotine 
gum use in the Lung Health Study was unrelated 

to  cardiovascular  diseases  or  other  serious  side 
effects Murray et al  A metaanalysis of  
clinical trials found no evidence of cardiovascular 
or other lifethreatening adverse effects caused by 
nicotine intake Greenland et al  Even in 
patients  with  established  cardiovascular  disease 
nicotine  use  in  the  form  of  NRTs  does  not 
increase  cardiovascular  risk  Woolf  et  al   
Benowitz  and  Gourlay    It  is  anticipated 
that  any  product  delivering  nicotine  without 
involving  combustion  such  as  the  EC  would 
confer  a  significantly  lower  risk  compared  with 
conventional cigarettes and to other nicotine con
taining combustible products

The  importance  of  using  nicotine  in  the  long
term was recognized several years ago by Russell 
indicating  that  the  potential  of  nicotine  delivery 
systems  as  longterm  alternatives  to  tobacco 
should be explored in order to make the elimina
tion  of  tobacco  a  realistic  future  target  Russell 
  However  current  regulations  restrict  the

longterm  use  of  pharmaceutical  or  recreational 
nicotine  products  such  as  snus  Le  Houezec 
et  al    In  other  words  nicotine  intake  has 
been demonized although evidence suggests that 
besides being useful in smoking cessation it may 
even have beneficial effects in a variety of disor
ders  such  as  Parkinsons  disease  Nielsen  et  al 
  depression  McClernon  et  al   
dementia  Sahakian  et  al    and  ulcerative 
colitis Guslandi  Obviously the addictive 
potential is an important factor in any decision to 
endorse  nicotine  administration  however 
it 
should be considered as slight collateral damage 
with minimal impact to vapers health compared 
with  the  tremendous  benefit  of  eliminating  all 
diseaserelated  substances  coming  from  tobacco 
smoking In fact smokers are already addicted to 
nicotine therefore the use of a cleaner form of 
nicotine  delivery  would  not  represent  any  addi
tional risk of addiction Surveys have shown that 
ECs are used as longterm substitutes to smoking 
Dawkins  et  al    Etter  and  Bullen   
Although  consumers  try  to  reduce  nicotine  use 
with ECs many are unable to completely stop its 
intake  indicating  an  important  role  for  nicotine 
in the ECs effectiveness as a smoking substitute 
Farsalinos et al b

Nicotine  overdose  or  intoxication  is  unlikely  to 
occur  with  vaping  since  the  amount  consumed 
Farsalinos  et  al  c  and  absorbed  Nides 
et al  Dawkins and Corcoran  is quite 
low  Moreover  although  not  yet  proven  it  is 
expected that vapers will selftitrate their nicotine 
intake  in  a  similar  way  to  tobacco  cigarettes 
Benowitz et al  Last but not least there is 
evidence suggesting that nicotine cannot be deliv
ered as fast and effectively from ECs compared to 
tobacco  cigarettes  Farsalinos  et  al   
Therefore it seems that ECs have a huge theoreti
cal  advantage  in  terms  of  health  risks  compared 
with conventional cigarettes due to the absence of 
toxic chemicals that are generated in vast quanti
ties by combustion Furthermore nicotine deliv
ery  by  ECs  is  unlikely  to  represent  a  significant 
safety  issue  particularly  when  considering  they 
are  intended  to  replace  tobacco  cigarettes  the 
most efficient nicotine delivery product

Studies on the safetyrisk profile of ECs
Findings  on  the  safetyrisk  profile  of  ECs  have 
just started to accumulate However this research 
must  be  considered  work  in  progress  given  that 
the safetyrisk of any product reflects an evolving 

body of knowledge and also because the product 
itself is undergoing constant development

Existing  studies  about  the  safetyrisk  profile  of 
ECs  can  be  divided  into  chemical  toxicological 
and clinical studies Table  Obviously clinical 
studies  are  the  most  informative  but  also  the 
most demanding because of several methodologi
cal logistical ethical and financial challenges In 
particular exploring safetyrisk profile in cohorts 
of  wellcharacterized  users  in  the  longterm  is 
required to address the potential of future disease 
development but it would take hundreds of users 
to be followed for a substantial number of years 
before any conclusions are made Therefore most 
research  is  currently  focused  on  in  vitro  effects 
with  clinical  studies  confined  into  evaluation  of 
shortterm use or pathophysiological mechanisms 
of smokingrelated diseases

Chemical studies
Chemical studies are relatively simple and cheap 
to  perform  and  provide  quick  results  However 
there are several disadvantages with this approach 
Research is usually focused on the known specific 
chemicals generally those known to be toxic from 
studies  of  cigarette  smoke  and  fails  to  address 
unknown  potentially  toxic  contaminants  that 
could be detected in the liquid or the emitted aer
osol Problems may also arise from the detection 
of  the  chemicals  in  flavors  Such  substances 
although  approved  for  use  in  the  food  industry 
have  largely  unknown  effects  when  heated  and 
inhaled thus information on the presence of such 
substances  is  difficult  to  interpret  in  terms  of  
in vivo effects In fact chemical studies do not pro
vide any objective information about the effects of 
use  they  can  only  be  used  to  calculate  the  risk 
based  on  theoretical  models  and  on  already  
established  safety  levels  determined  by  health 
authorities  An  overview  of  the  chemical  studies 
performed on ECs is displayed in Table

chemicals  such  as  heavy  metals  carcinogenic 
polycyclic  aromatic  hydrocarbons  and  phenols 
were  not  detected  with  the  exception  of  trivial 
amounts of mercury  ng per EC and traces 
of  formaldehyde  and  acetaldehyde  Laugesen

commercially  available  products 
in   
Westenberger    They  detected  the  pres
ence  of  tobaccospecific  nitrosamines  TSNAs 
but  did  not  declare  the  levels  found  Small 
amounts of diethylene glycol were also found in 
one sample which was unlikely to cause any harm 
from normal use Another study identified small 
amounts of aminotandalafil and rimonambant in 
EC liquids Hadwiger et al  Subsequently 
several 
laboratories  performed  similar  tests 
mostly on liquids with Cahn and Siegel publish
ing a review on the chemical analyses of ECs and 
comparing  the  findings  with  tobacco  cigarettes 
and  other  tobacco  products  Cahn  and  Siegel 
 They reported that TSNA levels were simi
lar  to  those  measured  in  pharmaceutical  NRTs 
The  authors  concluded  that  based  on  chemical 
analysis ECs are far less harmful compared with 
tobacco  cigarettes  The  most  comprehensive 
study on TSNAs has been performed recently by 
a  South  Korean  group  evaluating    liquids 
obtained  from  local  retailers  Kim  and  Shin 
 On average they found  g TSNAs 
per ml of liquid with the amount of daily expo
sure to the users estimated to be similar to users 
of NRTs Farsalinos et al d The estimated 
daily exposure to nitrosamines from tobacco ciga
rettes average consumption of  cigarettes per 
day  is  estimated  to  be  up  to    times  higher 

compared with EC use Table  Etter and col
leagues  evaluated  the  accuracy  of  nicotine  labe
ling and the presence of nicotine impurities and 
degradation  products  in    EC  liquid  samples 
Etter et al  They found that nicotine levels 
were    of  what  was  labeled  while  nico
tine  degradation  products  were  present  at  levels 
of  Although in some samples the levels 
were  higher  than  those  specified  in  European 
Pharmacopoeia  they  are  not  expected  to  cause 
any measurable harm to users

Besides the evaluation for the presence of TSNAs 
analyses have been performed for the detection of 
carbonyl compounds It is known that the thermal 
degradation of propylene glycol and glycerol can 
lead to the emission of toxic compounds such as 
aldehydes  Antal  et  al    Stein  et  al   
Goniewicz and colleagues evaluated the emission 
of    carbonyls  from    brands  of  ECs  mostly 
firstgeneration Goniewicz et al  In order 
to  produce  vapor  researchers  used  a  smoking 
machine  and  followed  a  regime  of  second 
puffs with a very short second interpuff inter
val  which  does  not  represent  realistic  use 
Farsalinos et al c although the puff dura
tion  was  low  interpuff  interval  was  remarkably 
short which could potentially lead to overheating 
In addition the same puff number was used in all

difference  in  the  design  and  liquid  content 
between devices Despite these limitations out of

et  al    the  levels  of  nickel  were  similar  to

Still the absolute levels were very low few nano
grams  per    puffs  Williams  et  al    
focused  their  research  on  the  presence  of  heavy 
metals  and  silicate  particles  emitted  from  ECs 
They  tested  poor  quality  firstgeneration  cart
omisers and found several metals emitted in the 
aerosol  of  the  EC  specifying  that  in  some  cases 
the  levels  were  higher  compared  with  conven
tional  cigarettes  As  mentioned  earlier  it  is  not 
unusual to find trace levels of metals in the vapor 
generated by these products under experimental 
conditions that bear little relevance to their nor
mal  use  however  it  is  unlikely  that  such  small 
amounts  pose  a  serious  threat  to  users  health 
Even if all the aerosol was absorbed by the con
sumer  which  is  not  the  case  since  most  of  the 
aerosol is visibly exhaled an average user would 
be exposed to  times lower amounts for most 
metals  than  the  maximum  daily  dose  allowance

Formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were also emit
ted from the nicotine inhalator although at lower

Burstyn has recently reviewed current data on the 
chemistry  of  aerosols  and  the  liquids  of  ECs 
including reports which were not peerreviewed 
and  estimated  the  risk  to  consumers  based  on 
workplace  exposure  standards  ie  Threshold 
Limit  Values  TLVs  Burstyn    After 
reviewing  all  available  evidence  the  author  con
cluded  that  there  was  no  evidence  that  vaping 
produced inhalable exposure to contaminants of 
aerosol  that  would  warrant  health  concerns  He 
added  that  surveillance  of  use  is  recommended 
due  to  the  high  levels  of  propylene  glycol  and 
glycerol  inhaled  which  are  not  considered  con
taminants  but  ingredients  of  the  EC  liquid 
There are limited data on the chronic inhalation 
of these chemicals by humans although there is 
some evidence from toxicological studies which 
are discussed later in this paper

In  conclusion  chemical  studies  have  found  that 
exposure to toxic chemicals from ECs is far lower 
compared  with  tobacco  cigarettes  Besides  com
paring  the  levels  of  specific  chemicals  released 
from  tobacco  and  ECs  it  should  be  taken  into 
consideration that the vast majority of the  
chemicals  present  in  tobacco  smoke  are  com
pletely absent from ECs Obviously surveillance 
of use is warranted in order to objectively evaluate 
the in vivo effects and because the effects of inhal
ing flavoring substances approved for food use are 
largely unknown

Toxicological studies
To  date  only  a  handful  of  toxicological  studies 
have been performed on ECs mostly cytotoxicity 
studies on established cell lines The cytotoxicity 
approach  also  has  its  flaws  Findings  cannot  be 
directly applied to the in vivo situation and there 
is always the risk of over as well as underesti
mating  the  interpretation  of  the  toxic  effects  in 
these investigational models An ample degree of 
results variability is to be expected from different 
cell  lines  and  sometimes  also  within  the  same 
cell  line  Comparing  the  potential  cytotoxicity 
effects of EC vapor with those resulting from the 
exposure  of  cigarette  smoke  should  be  manda
tory  but  standards  for  vapor  production  and 
exposure protocols have not been clearly defined

Bahl and colleagues Bahl et al  performed 
cytotoxicity  tests  on    EC  liquids  in  human 
embryonic  stem  cells  mouse  neural  stem  cells 
and human pulmonary fibroblasts and found that 
stem cells were more sensitive to the effects of the 
liquids  with    samples  being  moderately  cyto
toxic  and    samples  being  highly  cytotoxic 
Propylene glycol and glycerol were not cytotoxic 
but  a  correlation  between  cytotoxicity  and  the 
number and height of the flavoring peaks in high
performance  liquid  chromatography  was  noted 
Investigations were just restricted to the effect of 
EC liquids and not to their vapors thus limiting 
the importance of the study findings this is not a 
trivial issue considering that the intended use of 
these products is by inhalation only and that it is 
unlikely  that  flavoring  substances  in  the  EC  liq
uids will still be present in the aerosol in the same 
amount  due  to  differences  in  evaporation  tem

cultured  for    hours  with  continuous  exposure

lasts  for    seconds  per  puff  and  most  of  the 
aerosol  is  visibly  exhaled  Finally  Cinnamon

Romagna  and  colleagues  Romagna  et  al   
performed the first cytotoxicity study of EC vapor 
on fibroblast cells They used a standardized ISO 
  protocol  which  is  used  for  regulatory 
purposes  of  medical  devices and  products They 
tested the vapor of  liquid samples containing 
the  same  amount  of  nicotine    mgml  gener
ated by a commercially available EC device Cells 
were  incubated  for    hours  with  each  of  these 
vapors and with smoke from a conventional ciga
rette Only one sample was found to be margin
ally cytotoxic whereas cigarette smoke was highly 
cytotoxic approximately  more cytotoxic 
even when the extract was diluted up to  of 
the original concentration

The  same  group  also  investigated  the  cytotoxic 
potential  of    EC  liquid  samples  in  cardiomyo
blasts Farsalinos et al a Vapor was produced 
by  using  a  commercially  available  EC  device 
Samples  contained  a  wide  range  of  nicotine  con
centrations A base liquid mixture of propylene gly
col and glycerol no nicotine and no flavorings was 
also included as an additional experimental control 
Four of the samples examined were made by using 
cured tobacco leaves in a steeping process allowing 
them to impregnate a mixture of propylene glycol 
and  glycerol  for  several  days  before  being  filtered 
and bottled for use Of note this was the first study 
which evaluated a limited number of samples with 
an EC device delivering higher voltage and energy 
to the atomizer thirdgeneration device In total 
four samples were found to be cytotoxic three of 
them  were  liquids  made  by  using  cured  tobacco 
leaves  with  cytotoxicity  observed  at  both   
and  extract concentration while one sample 
cinnamon  flavor  was  marginally  cytotoxic  at 
  extract  concentration  only  In  comparison 
smoke  from  three  tobacco  cigarettes  was  highly 
cytotoxic  with  toxicity  observed  even  when  the 

extract  was  diluted  to   The  samples  made 
with tobacco leaves were three times less cytotoxic 
compared with cigarette smoke this was probably 
due to the absence of combustion and the signifi
cantly lower temperature of evaporation in EC use 
Concerning highvoltage EC use the authors found 
slightly  reduced  cell  viability  without  any  of  the 
samples  being  cytotoxic  according  to  the  ISO 
 definition Finally no association between 
cell survival and the amount of nicotine present in 
the liquids was noted

A recent study evaluated in more detail the cyto
toxic potential of eight cinnamonflavored EC liq
uids in human embryonic stem cells and human 
pulmonary  fibroblasts  Behar  et  al    The 
authors  found  that  the  flavoring  substance  pre
dominantly present was cinnamaldehyde which is 
approved for food use They observed significant 
cytotoxic effects mostly on stem cells but also on 
fibroblasts  with  cytotoxicity  associated  with  the 
amount of cinnamaldehyde present in the liquid 
However major methodological issues arose from 
this  study  Once  again  cytotoxicity  was  just 
restricted  to  EC  liquids  and  not  to  their  vapors 
Moreover the authors mentioned that the amount 
of cinnamaldehyde differed between liquids by up 
to  times and this raises the suspicion of test
ing  concentrated  flavor  rather  than  refills  By 
searching the internet and contacting manufactur
ers based on the names of samples and suppliers 
mentioned in the manuscript it was found that at 
least four of their samples were not refills but con
centrated flavors Surprisingly the levels of cinna
maldehyde found to be cytotoxic were about  
times lower than those currently approved for use

longterm  health  implications  were  detected  It 
should be reminded that in these circumstances 
nonpharmaceutical  purity  propylene  glycol  is 
used and in some cases oils are added making it 
difficult to interpret the results in the context of 
EC  use  Evidence  for  the  potential  harm  of 
inhaled glycerol is sparse A study using Sprague

metaplasia  of  the  epiglottis  epithelium  in  the 
highdose  group  only  without  any  changes 
observed  in  lungs  or  other  organs  Renne  et  al 
  No  comparative  set  of  experiments  with 
cigarette smoke was included but it is well known 
that exposure to tobacco smoke in similar animal 
models  leads  to  dramatic  changes  in  the  lungs 
liver and kidneys Czekaj et al 

In  conclusion  toxicological  studies  have  shown 
significantly  lower  adverse  effects  of  EC  vapor 
compared with cigarette smoke Characteristically 
the studies performed by using the liquids in their 
original  liquid  form  have  found  less  favorable 
results  however  no  comparison  with  tobacco 
smoke was performed in any of these studies and 
they  cannot  be  considered  relevant  to  EC  use 
since the samples were not tested in the form con
sumed  by  vapers  More  research  is  needed 
including  studies  on  different  cell  lines  such  as 
lung  epithelial  cells  In  addition  it  is  probably 
necessary  to  evaluate  a  huge  number  of  liquids 
with different flavors since a minority of them in 
an  unpredictable  manner  appear  to  raise  some 
concerns  when  tested  in  the  aerosol  form  pro
duced by using an EC device

Clinical studies and research surveys
Clinical  trials  can  be  very  informative  but  they 
require monitoring of hundreds of users for many 
years to adequately explore the safetyrisk profile 
of the products under investigation Research sur
veys of EC users on the other hand can quickly 
provide information about the potential harm of 
these  products  and  are  much  cheaper  to  run 
However  selfreported  data  highly  selfselected 
study populations and the crosssectional design 
are  some  of  the  most  common  limitations  of 
research  surveys Taken  together  findings  from 
surveys  and  followup  studies  of  vapers  have 
shown that EC use is relatively safe

Polosa and colleagues followed up smokers for  
months  after  a  month  period  of  intervention 
during which ECs were given Polosa et al a 
Only  mild  symptoms  such  as  mouth  and  throat 

irritation and dry cough were observed Farsalinos 
and  colleagues  retrospectively  evaluated  a  group 
of  EC users who had completely quit smoking 
and were daily EC users for a median period of  
months Farsalinos et al b Throat irritation 
and cough were the most commonly reported side 
effects  Similar  findings  have  been  observed  in 
surveys  Dawkins  et  al    Etter  et  al   
However it is expected that dedicated users who 
have  more  positive  experiences  and  fewer  side 
effects compared with the general population par
ticipate  in  such  studies  therefore  interpretation 
should be done with caution The only two exist
ing randomized controlled trials have also included 
detailed  EC  safety  analysis  The  ECLAT  study 
Caponnetto  et  al  b  a  threearm  con
trolled randomized clinical trial designed to com
pare efficacy and safety of a firstgeneration device 
with   or  mg nicotine cartridges reported 
clinically  significant  progressive  health  improve
ments already  by  week  two of  continuous  use of 
the  device  and  no  serious  adverse  events  ie 
major depression abnormal behavior or any event 
requiring an unscheduled visit to the family prac
titioner  or  hospitalization  occurred  during  the 
study The ASCEND study Bullen et al  a 
threearm  controlled  randomized  clinical  trial 
designed  to  compare  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  a 
firstgeneration device with or without nicotine 
with nicotine patches reported no serious adverse 
events in any of the three study groups

Few clinical studies have been performed to evalu
ate the shortterm in vivo effects of EC use in cur
rent  or  former  smokers Vardavas  and  colleagues

Two studies have evaluated the shortterm effects 
of  ECs  on  the  cardiovascular  system  Farsalinos 
and colleagues evaluated the acute effects of using 
ECs with an  mgml nicotinecontaining liquid 
on  hemodynamics  and  left  ventricular  function 
in comparison with the effects of cigarette smok
ing Farsalinos et al  They found that EC 
use resulted in a slight elevation in diastolic blood 
pressure  while  after  smoking  both  systolic  and 
diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were sig
nificantly elevated Obviously this was due to the 
relatively low nicotine content of the EC which is 
considered medium strength Diastolic dysfunc
tion  was  observed  in  smokers  after  smoking 
which  was  in  line  with  findings  from  previous 
studies  However  no  adverse  effects  were 
observed in EC users after using the device ad lib 
for  minutes Another study by the same group 
Farsalinos  et  al  f  evaluated  the  acute 
effects of EC use on coronary flow In particular 
they measured the flow velocity reserve of the left 
anterior descending coronary artery by echocar
diography  after  intravenous  infusion  of  adeno
sine representing the maximal ability of the artery 
to deliver blood to the myocardium Smoking was

A clinical case report of a smoker suffering from 
chronic  idiopathic  neutrophilia  was  published 
According 
that  report  Farsalinos  and 
Romagna  switching from smoking to EC 
use  led  to  a  reversal  of  the  condition  after   
months  In  addition  Creactive  protein  levels 
which were consistently elevated for more than  
years  decreased  to  normal  levels  Another  case 
report  of  a  patient  with  lipoid  pneumonia  was 
published with the condition attributed to glyc
erinbased  EC  liquids  used  by  the  patient 
McCauley et al  However glycerin is an 
alcohol polyol and thus it is impossible to cause 

One study evaluated the acute effects of tobacco 
and  EC  use  on  white  blood  cell  count  Flouris 
et  al    Smoking  one  tobacco  cigarette 
caused  an  immediate  elevation  in  white  blood 
cells  neutrophils  and  lymphocytes  indicating 
acute inflammatory distress On the contrary no 
differences were observed after using ECs

In  conclusion  clinical  studies  evaluating  the 
effects of shortterm EC use on selected cardio
vascular  and  respiratory  functional  outcomes 
have  shown  that  even  if  some  harmful  effects  of 
vaping are reported these are considerably milder 
compared  with  smoking  conventional  cigarettes 
However  it  is  difficult  to  assess  the  prognostic 
implications of these studies longerterm data are 
needed before any definite conclusions are made

Passive vaping
Passive smoking is an established risk factor for a 
variety  of  diseases  Barnoya  and  NavasAcien 
  Therefore  it  is  important  from  a  public 
health perspective to examine the impact of EC use 
on  bystanders  Indirect  data  can  be  derived  from 
chemical studies in vapor mentioned above which 
show  that  the  potential  of  any  significant  adverse 
effects on bystanders is minimal In fact since side
stream  exposure  is  nonexistent  in  EC  aerosol  is 
produced only during activation of the device while 
tobacco cigarettes emit smoke even when no puffs 
are taken such studies are undoubtedly overesti
mating the risk of environmental exposure

Few studies have focused on secondhand vaping 
McAuley  and  colleagues  McAuley  et  al   
although mentioning indoor air quality in the title 
of their study and finding minimal healthrelated 
impact did not in fact evaluate secondhand vap
ing  because  aerosol  was  produced  from  an  EC 
device and was evaluated without previously being 
inhaled  by  any  user  Moreover  there  were  some 
problems  with  crosscontamination  with  tobacco 
cigarette smoke which made the results somewhat 
questionable at least for some of the parameters 
tested  Schripp  and  colleagues  Schripp  et  al 
 evaluated the emissions from an EC by ask
ing a volunteer to use three different EC devices in 
a  closed    m  chamber  From  a  selection  of   
chemicals  analyzed  only  formaldehyde  acrolein 
isoprene  acetaldehyde  and  acetic  acid  were 

httptawsagepubcom 



Therapeutic Advances in Drug Safety 

detected The levels were  times lower com
pared  with  emissions  from  a  conventional  ciga
rette  For  formaldehyde  the  authors  specifically 
mentioned that the levels were continuously rising 
from  the  time  the  volunteer  entered  the  room 
even before he started using the EC Moreover no 
acute  elevation  was  observed  when  the  smoker 
used the three EC devices contrary to the acute 
elevation and spiking of levels when a tobacco cig
arette was lit The authors concluded that formal
dehyde was not emitted from the ECs but was due 
to  human  contamination  since  low  amounts  of 
formaldehyde of endogenous origin can be found 
in  exhaled  breath  Riess  et  al    Romagna 
and  colleagues  Romagna  et  al    evaluated 
chemicals released in a realistic setting of a  m 
room by asking five smokers to smoke ad lib for  
hours and five vapers to use ECs ad lib for a similar 
period of time on two separate days Nicotine acr
olein  toluene  xylene  and  polycyclic  aromatic 
hydrocarbons were detected in room air after the 
smoking session with the amount of total organic 
carbon  TOC  reaching  to    mgm  In  con
trast  after  the  EC  session  only  glycerol  was 
detected in minimal levels  gm while TOC 
level  of    mgm 
reached  a  maximum 
Characteristically  the  amount  of TOC  accumu
lated  after    hours  of  EC  use  was  similar  to  the 
amount  found  after  just    minutes  of  smoking 
The study on heavy metals mentioned previously 
Williams et al  could also be used to exam
ine  any  potential  risk  of  bystanders  exposure  to 
toxic metals The levels of heavy metals found in 
vapor were minimal and considering the disper
sion of these molecules in the whole room air it is 
unlikely that any of these metals could be present 
in  measurable  quantities  in  the  environment 
Therefore the risk for bystanders would be liter
ally  nonexistent  Contrary  to  that  Schober  and 
colleagues Schober et al  found that levels 
of aluminum were raised by  times in a  m 
room where volunteers were asked to use ECs for 
 hours This is a highly unexpected finding which 
cannot be supported by the findings of the study 
by Williams and colleagues Williams et al  
because  the  levels  found  in  the  latter  could  not 
result in such elevation of the environmental levels 
of  aluminum  unless  nothing  is  retained  in  or 
absorbed from the lungs Moreover Schober and 
colleagues Schober et al  found that levels 
of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons PAHs were 
raised  by    after  EC  use  However  a  major 
methodological problem of this study is that con
trol environmental measurements were performed 
on a separate day and not on the same day of EC 

use This is a major limitation because the levels 
of  environmental  PAHs  have  significant  diurnal 
and daytoday variations Ravindra et al  
therefore it is highly likely that the differences in 
levels  of  PAHs  which  are  mainly  products  of 
combustion  and  are  not  expected  to  be  emitted 
from EC use represented changes due to environ
mental  conditions  and  not  due  to  EC  use 
Bertholon and colleagues Bertholon et al  
examined the EC aerosol exhaled from a user in 
comparison  with  exhaled  smoke  from  a  smoker 
The  authors  found  that  particle  size  diameters 
were m They observed that the half 
life of EC aerosol was  seconds compared with 
  minutes  for  cigarette  smoke  indicating  that 
risk  of  passive  vaping  exposure  is  significantly 
lower compared with passive smoking

The  recent  findings  by  Czogala  and  colleagues 
Czogala  et  al    led  to  similar  conclusions 
The authors compared the emissions of electronic 
and conventional cigarettes generated by experi
enced  dual  users  in  a  ventilated  fullsized  room 
and found that ECs may emit detectable amounts 
of nicotine depending on the specific EC brand 
tested  but  no  carbon  monoxide  and  volatile 
organic  carbons  However  the  average  ambient 
levels of nicotine of ECs were  times lower than 
those of conventional cigarettes    ver
sus    gm

In his review and comparison with TLVs Burstyn 
found  that  emissions  from  ECs  to  the  environ
ment  are  not  expected  to  pose  any  measurable 
risk for bystanders Burstyn 

An issue that needs further clarification relates to 
the findings of microparticles emitted from ECs In 
most studies these findings are presented in a way 
implying that the risk is similar to environmental or 
smoking microparticles In reality it is not just the 
size but the composition of the microparticles that 
matters  Environmental  microparticles  are  mainly 
carbon  metal  acid  and  organic  microparticles 
many  of  which  result  from  combustion  and  are 
commonly  called  particulate  matter  Particulate 
matter  exposure  is  definitely  associated  with  lung 
and  cardiovascular  disease  Peters    Seaton 
et al  In the case of ECs microparticles are 
expected  to  consist  mostly  of  propylene  glycol 
glycerol  water  and  nicotine  droplets  Metal  and 
silica nanoparticles may also be present Williams 
et al  but in general emissions from ECs are 
incomparable to environmental particulate matter 
or cigarette smoke microparticles

Flouris and colleagues Flouris et al  per
formed the only clinical study evaluating the res
piratory effects of passive vaping compared with 
passive  smoking  Researchers  found  significant 
adverse  effects  in  spirometry  parameters  after 
being  exposed  to  passive  smoking  for    hour 
while no adverse effects were observed after expo
sure to passive vaping

Although evaluating the effects of passive vap
ing requires further work based on the existing 
evidence  from  environmental  exposure  and 
chemical analyses of vapor it is safe to conclude 
that  the  effects  of  EC  use  on  bystanders  
are  minimal  compared  with  conventional 
cigarettes

Miscellaneous safety issues

Specific subpopulations psychiatric and 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder 
patients
A  challenging  population  subgroup  with  unique 
smoking  patterns  is  that  of  psychiatric  patients 
and  in  particular  schizophrenic  patients  This 
subpopulation  is  characterized  by  a  very  high 
smoking  prevalence  De  Leon  and  Diaz   
with  an  excess  of  smokingrelated  mortality 
Brown  et  al    Currently  only  NRTs  are 
recommended  to  treat  nicotine  dependence  in 
this  specific  subpopulation  but  in  general  they 
are not particularly effective Aubin et al  
ECs  could  be  used  as  an  alternative  to  smoking 
products  in  this  group  Caponnetto  and  col
leagues  performed  a  prospective  month  pilot 
study to evaluate the efficacy of EC use in smok
ing  reduction  and  cessation  in  a  group  of   
patients  with  schizophrenia  Caponnetto  et  al 
a  In    of  participants  smoking  con
sumption went from  to  cigarettes per day at 
 weeks of follow up while  managed to 
quit  smoking  Importantly  no  deterioration  in 
their psychiatric condition was observed and side 
effects were mild and temporary The results were 
promising  although  an  outdated  EC  device  was 
used in this study

There  is  also  anecdotal  evidence  that  successful 
smoking cessation could be attained by using an 
EC in smokers with other psychiatric conditions 
such  as  depression  Caponnetto  et  al  a 
Both patients described in this case series stated 
that  EC  use  was  well  tolerated  and  no  adverse 
events were reported

Considering  that  firstline  oral  medications  for 
nicotine  addiction  are  contraindicated  in  such 
patients  prescribing  information  for  bupropion 
and  varenicline  carry  a  blackbox  warning  for 
certain  psychiatric  conditions  ECs  may  be  a 
in  these  challenging  patient 
promising  tool 
groups

Another  subpopulation  that  may  benefit  from 
regular EC use is that of respiratory patients with 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD 
a progressive disease characterized by a persistent 
inflammatory  response  to  tobacco  smoke  that 
generally  leads  to  decline  in  lung  function  res
piratory 
failure  cor  pulmonale  and  death 
Consequently  smoking  cessation  plays  a  crucial 
part  in  the  management  of  COPD  patients 
However  the  available  evidence  in  the  medical 
literature  indicates  that  COPD  patients  who 
smoke  respond  poorly  to  smoking  cessation 
efforts Schiller and Ni  To date no formal 
efficacy and safety assessment of EC use in COPD 
patients  has  been  conducted There  is  only  evi
dence  from  a  case  report  of  inveterate  smokers 
with COPD and a documented history of recur
ring relapses who eventually quit tobacco smok
ing  on  their  own  by  using  an  EC  Caponnetto 
et al b Significant improvement in quality 
of  life  and  reduction  in  the  number  of  disease 
exacerbations were noted EC use was well toler
ated with no reported adverse events

Accidental nicotine exposure
Accidental  ingestion  of  nicotine  especially  by 
children  or  skin  contact  with  large  amounts  of 
liquid  or  highly  concentrated  nicotine  solution 
can  be  an  issue  However  the  historically  refer
enced lethal dose of  mg has recently been chal
lenged  in  a  review  by  Mayer  Mayer    he 
found that the lethal levels currently reproduced 
in  every  document  originated  from  dubious 
experiments  performed  in  the  th  century 
Based on postmortem studies he suggested that 
the  acute  dose  associated  with  a  lethal  outcome 
would be  mg Taking into account that 
voluminous vomiting is the first and characteristic 
symptom  of  nicotine  ingestion  it  seems  that  far 
higher  levels  of  nicotine  need  to  be  ingested  in 
order to have lethal consequences

A surveillance system of adverse events has been 
developed  by  the  FDA  which  identifies  safety 
concerns  in  relation  to  tobacco  products  Since 
    adverse  events  were  reported  for  ECs

Chen  Eight of them were serious events 
such as hospitalizations for pneumonia heart fail
ure seizures and hypotension and burns A case 
of seconddegree burns was caused by a battery 
explosion which is generally a problem observed 
in  lithium  batteries  and  has  occurred  in  other 
products  such  as  mobile  phones  The  author 
emphasized  that  the  reported  events  were  not 
necessarily associated with EC use but may have 
been  related  to  preexisting  conditions  or  other 
causes No condition was characteristically asso
ciated with EC use

A recent review of the California Poison Control 
System database from  to  identified  
cases  children associated with EC exposure 
accidental  exposure  in    cases  Cantrell 
 A total of five patients were evaluated in an 
emergency  department  and  all  were  discharged 
within    hours  Nausea  vomiting  dizziness  and 
oral  irritation  were  most  commonly  reported 
Taken together data from surveillance systems of 
adverse  events  suggest  that  shortterm  adverse 
effects and accidental exposures to EC cartridges 
are unlikely to result in serious toxicity

Notwithstanding  avoiding  preventable  contact 
with  highly  concentrated  nicotine  solution 
remains important this can be achieved by spe
cific  labeling  of  the  products  childproof  caps 
and proper education of consumers There is no 
evidence  that  nicotinecontaining  EC  liquids 
should be treated in any different way compared

powder etc

Electrical accidents and fires
The  electronic  equipment  of  ECs  may  be  the 
cause for accidents ECs are mainly composed of 
lithium  batteries  There  have  been  reports  of 
explosions  of  batteries  caused  either  by  pro
longed charging and use of improper chargers or 
by design defects Similar accidents have occurred 
with  batteries  of  other  popular  devices  such  as 
mobile  phones  Therefore  this  does  not  occur 
specifically with ECs however quality standards 
of  production  should  be  used  in  order  to  avoid 
such accidents

Smoking  is  a  major  cause  of  residential  fires 
Between    and    an  estimated  annual 
average of  smokingrelated fires occurred in 
the  US  US  Fire 
in 
residential  buildings 

Administration  They account for only  
of all residential building fires but for  of fire 
deaths  Since  ECs  are  activated  only  when  used 
by the person and there is no combustion involved 
there is the potential to avoid the risk of smoking
related fires

Use by youngsters and nonsmokers
Although  beyond  the  scope  of  this  review  it  is 
important to briefly discuss the potential for addic
tion from EC use It should be acknowledged that 
nicotine is addictive although recent studies have 
shown  that  several  other  chemicals  present  in 
tobacco are associated with a significant enhance
ment  of  the  addictiveness  of  nicotine  Lotfipour 
et al  Rose  Guillem et al  Still 
nicotine  intake  should  not  be  recommended  to 
nonsmokers Smokers are already addicted to nic
otine thus ECs will be a cleaner form of nicotine 
intake  while  at  the  same  time  they  will  maintain 
their sensory stimulation and motor simulation of 
smoking these are important aspects of the addic
tion  to  smoking  Regulatory  authorities  have 
expressed concern about EC use by youngsters or 
by neversmokers with ECs becoming a gateway 
to smoking or becoming a new form of addiction 
However  such  concerns  are  unsubstantiated 
research has shown that EC use by youngsters is 
virtually  nonexistent  unless  they  are  smokers 
Camenga  and  colleagues  Camenga  et  al   
examined the use of ECs and tobacco in a group of 
adolescents in a survey conducted in three waves 
In  the  first  wave  of  the  survey  February   
 adolescents were surveyed from which only 
one nonsmoker was found to be using ECs In the 
second  and  third  wave  of  the  surveys  only  five 
nonsmoking adolescents were using ECs In fact 
these are adolescents who reported first ever use of 
ECs  in  the  past    days  therefore  they  were  not 
necessarily  regular  or  daily  EC  consumers  The 
increased prevalence of EC use from  in  
to  in  concerned smoking adolescents 
therefore it should be considered a positive finding 
that  smokers  are  experimenting  with  the  signifi
cantly less harmful ECs Similarly the Medicines 
and  Healthcare  Products  Regulatory  Agency 
MHRA found that less than  of EC users are 
neversmokers  MHRA    Data  from  the 
Centers for Disease Control  National Youth 
Tobacco Survey reported doubling in EC experi
mentation by  year old students from  
in  to  in  however  of them 
were  smokers  From  the  whole  population  only 
  were  nonsmokers  experimenting  with  ECs

Once  again  participants  were  asked  about  ever 
experimenting with an EC in the past  days not 
regular or daily EC use Recently a survey of more 
than    students  in  South  Korea  was  pub
lished Lee et al  Although they found that 
  of  them  were  daily  smokers    were 
using only tobacco cigarettes and  were using 
both tobacco and ECs only  of nonsmokers 
had  used  ECs  in  the  past    days Although  the 
above  mentioned  data  have  been  used  as  argu
ments to support the fact that a new epidemic of 
nicotine  addiction  through  the  use  of  ECs  is 
appearing  in  reality  they  are  showing  that  any 
experimentation  with  ECs  is  done  by  smokers 
This is in fact a positive finding and could lead to 
reduced smoking prevalence through adoption of 
EC  use Therefore  ECs  could  serve  as  gateway 
from smoking on the contrary there is no evidence 
indicating that they could be a gateway to smoking 
It is promising to see that penetration of EC use in 
youngsters is virtually nonexistent especially when 
you take into consideration that there is currently 
no official regulation in most countries to prohibit 
the access to ECs by youngsters

et al  Yudkin et al  Nonetheless more 
research is needed in several areas such as atom
izer design and materials to further reduce toxic 
emissions and improve nicotine delivery and liq
uid  ingredients  to  determine  the  relative  risk  of 
the  variety  of  compounds  mostly  flavorings 
inhaled Regulations need to be implemented in 
order to maintain the current situation of minimal 
penetration of EC use in nonsmokers and young
sters  while  manufacturers  should  be  forced  to 
provide  proof  for  the  quality  of  the  ingredients 
used  and  to  perform  tests  on  the  efficiency  and 
safety of their products However any regulatory 
decisions  should  not  compromise  the  variability 
of  choices  for  consumers  and  should  make  sure 
that  ECs  are  more  easily  accessible  compared 
with their main competitor the tobacco cigarette 
Consumers deserve and should make informed 
decisions  and  research  will  definitely  promote 
this In particular current data on safety evalua
tion  and  risk  assessment  of  ECs  is  sufficient 
enough to avert restrictive regulatory measures as 
a consequence of an irrational application of the 
precautionary principle Saitta et al 

Conclusion
Existing evidence indicates that EC use is by far a 
less  harmful  alternative  to  smoking There  is  no 
tobacco and no combustion involved in EC use 
therefore regular vapers may avoid several harm
ful toxic chemicals that are typically present in the 
smoke  of  tobacco  cigarettes  Indeed  some  toxic 
chemicals  are  released  in  the  EC  vapor  as  well 
but their levels are substantially lower compared 
with tobacco smoke and in some cases such as 
nitrosamines  are  comparable  with  the  amounts 
found 
in  pharmaceutical  nicotine  products 
Surveys  clinical  chemistry  and  toxicology  data 
have  often  been  mispresented  or  misinterpreted 
by  health  authorities  and  tobacco  regulators  in 
such a way that the potential for harmful conse
quences of EC use has been largely exaggerated 
Polosa and Caponnetto  It is obvious that 
some residual risk associated with EC use may be 
present but this is probably trivial compared with 
smoking 
the  devastating  consequences  of 
Moreover ECs are recommended to smokers or 
former smokers only as a substitute for conven
tional  cigarettes  or  to  prevent  smoking  relapse 
thus any risk should be estimated relative to the 
risk  of  continuing  or  relapsing  back  to  smoking 
and the low efficacy of currently approved medi
cations  for  smoking  cessation  should  be  taken 
into  consideration  Moore  et  al    Rigotti  

ECs are a revolutionary product in tobacco harm 
reduction  Although  they  emit  vapor  which 
resembles smoke there is literally no fire com
bustion and no fire suspicion or evidence that 
they may be the cause for disease in a similar way 
to tobacco cigarettes Due to their unique char
acteristics  ECs  represent  a  historical  opportu
nity  to  save  millions  of  lives  and  significantly 
reduce  the  burden  of  smokingrelated  diseases
